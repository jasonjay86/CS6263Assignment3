  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

  "review": "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

  "review": "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen.

They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",

The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen.

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set.

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film.

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives. While it may touch on important issues, the lack of a clear motive makes it a challenging watch. It's important to recognize the value of storytelling in films and avoid creating aimless projects in the future.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

{
  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

{
  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives.

    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have focused heavily on 3D effects and gore, that can be appealing to certain audiences looking for a thrilling experience. The visuals and shock factor of flesh-eating zombies in 3D could be entertaining for fans of the genre who enjoy that kind of spectacle."

  "review": "I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a film that was once considered pornographic but is now appreciated for its artistic approach to depicting sex and nudity within the context of Swedish cinema.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's exploration of sex and nudity is done in a tasteful and artistic manner, rather than for mere shock value. It offers a unique perspective on Swedish cinema and its cultural attitudes towards sexuality.",

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "review": "Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have focused heavily on 3D effects and gore, that can be appealing to certain audiences looking for a thrilling experience.

Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film.

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall. It's possible that some viewers may appreciate certain aspects of the film that the reviewer overlooked. I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

  "review": "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters.

It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged.

John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen.

  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously.

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

  "review": "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously.

Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film sounds like a pretentious mess that tries too hard to be edgy and provocative but fails miserably. The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target.

Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey.

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",

The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters.

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film.

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the reviewer's disappointment with the casting choices and overall execution of the film, I believe that every movie has its own unique qualities and can be appreciated for different reasons. It's possible that some viewers may find value in the portrayal of Dorothy Stratten's story, even if it didn't meet the reviewer's expectations."

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey.

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling. overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the film may not be the best in terms of storyline or overall quality, it does have a certain charm that makes it enjoyable to watch, especially for cheap laughs. Jebidia's performance was a standout and added to the entertainment value of the movie.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may have provided some cheap laughs and entertainment value, I found the storyline to be too lacking and the overall quality too low to justify watching it multiple times. Jebidia's performance may have been good, but I don't believe it was Oscar-worthy."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk. It inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, making the zombie attacks predictable. The film is filled with continuity mistakes and diabolical acting, making it unbearable to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The film's poor technical execution, lack of originality, and predictable nature make it a painful viewing experience. The amateurish acting and continuity errors only add to the overall disappointment. It's definitely a film to avoid.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While The Zombie Chronicles may have its flaws, it still offers some entertainment value for fans of bad movies. The over-the-top acting and continuity mistakes can be seen as part of the charm of low-budget horror films. Despite its shortcomings, it can be enjoyed for its campy appeal."

  "review": "I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie are going to be bad. After not watching it for more than a year I finally watched it. What a pathetic movie. I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. This movie sounds like a complete disaster from start to finish. The lack of production value, poor acting, and nonsensical plot make it seem like a waste of time and resources. It's disappointing to see such low-quality films being made and distributed.",
  "disagree": "I have to disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, it's important to remember that filmmaking is a creative process that can vary in quality. Just because a movie has a low budget or amateur actors doesn't automatically make it bad. Sometimes these types of films can surprise viewers with their unique storytelling or charm. It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

  "review": "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a film that was once considered pornographic but is now appreciated for its artistic approach to depicting sex and nudity within the context of Swedish cinema.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's exploration of sex and nudity is done in a tasteful and artistic manner, rather than for mere shock value. It offers a unique perspective on Swedish cinema and its cultural attitudes towards sexuality.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film doesn't have much of a plot. While the focus may be on the exploration of sex and politics, Lena's journey to understand life and society provides a compelling narrative thread that drives the film forward."

{
  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives. While it may touch on important issues, the lack of a clear motive makes it a challenging watch. It's important to recognize the value of storytelling in films and avoid creating aimless projects in the future.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

While acknowledging the strengths of realistic acting and impressive cinematography, I believe that the portrayal of silliness and the actress's performance could be interpreted differently. The comparison to Godard's film and the societal ideals may not fully capture the essence and intention of this particular movie."

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

It's understandable why the reviewer suggests avoiding it altogether.",

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",

Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight.

Awful simply awful.",

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).

It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target.

Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky.

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey.

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well.

The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).

They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

  "review": "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience. The 3-D format being wasted adds to the overall sense of dissatisfaction. Viewers deserve better than this kind of unimaginative and poorly executed film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles.

  "review": "I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a film that was once considered pornographic but is now appreciated for its artistic approach to depicting sex and nudity within the context of Swedish cinema.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's exploration of sex and nudity is done in a tasteful and artistic manner, rather than for mere shock value. It offers a unique perspective on Swedish cinema and its cultural attitudes towards sexuality.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film doesn't have much of a plot. While the focus may be on the exploration of sex and politics, Lena's journey to understand life and society provides a compelling narrative thread that drives the film forward."

{
  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

    "review": "This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story. One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives. While it may touch on important issues, the lack of a clear motive makes it a challenging watch. It's important to recognize the value of storytelling in films and avoid creating aimless projects in the future.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

    "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh assessment of the film. While acknowledging the strengths of realistic acting and impressive cinematography, I believe that the portrayal of silliness and the actress's performance could be interpreted differently. The comparison to Godard's film and the societal ideals may not fully capture the essence and intention of this particular movie."

  "review": "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

It's understandable why the reviewer suggests avoiding it altogether.",

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target.

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall. It's possible that some viewers may appreciate certain aspects of the film that the reviewer overlooked. I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

  "review": "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey.

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

  "review": "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams 'seriously, you could do better yourself'. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes' films have consistently disappointed with their lackluster storytelling and poor production quality. The criticism of the acting and overall presentation of the film is spot on. It's disheartening to see such uninspired work being put out into the world.",

Not every film needs to be a masterpiece to have its own charm or entertainment value.

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life.

The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate.

It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously.

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release.

Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).

I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters.

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters.

It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall. It's possible that some viewers may appreciate certain aspects of the film that the reviewer overlooked. I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

  "review": "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!

YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving.

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.

I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines.

  "review": "I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment of the editing in the movie. The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a film that was once considered pornographic but is now appreciated for its artistic approach to depicting sex and nudity within the context of Swedish cinema.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's exploration of sex and nudity is done in a tasteful and artistic manner, rather than for mere shock value. It offers a unique perspective on Swedish cinema and its cultural attitudes towards sexuality.",

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "review": "Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have focused heavily on 3D effects and gore, that can be appealing to certain audiences looking for a thrilling experience. The visuals and shock factor of flesh-eating zombies in 3D could be entertaining for fans of the genre who enjoy that kind of spectacle."

Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",

The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar.

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life.

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible.

To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives.

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers.

Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it.

Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate.

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring.

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives. While it may touch on important issues, the lack of a clear motive makes it a challenging watch. It's important to recognize the value of storytelling in films and avoid creating aimless projects in the future.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams 'seriously, you could do better yourself'. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",

The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged.

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it.

Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life.

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate.

I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",

Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",

The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen.

  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

  "review": "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",
  "agree": "I agree with the review. The lack of nudity, the anachronistic car choice, and the poor stereoscopic 3D effects all detract from the overall viewing experience of the movie. It's disappointing when these elements are not executed well in a film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have its flaws such as the lack of nudity and continuity errors, the criticism towards the 3D effects seems exaggerated. The reviewer's personal preference for the actress playing the daughter may also skew their overall judgment of the film."

The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams 'seriously, you could do better yourself'. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes' films have consistently disappointed with their lackluster storytelling and poor production quality. The criticism of the acting and overall presentation of the film is spot on. It's disheartening to see such uninspired work being put out into the world.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the criticisms leveled at Brad Sykes and his films, I believe there is still value in exploring different perspectives on zombie-related content. Not every film needs to be a masterpiece to have its own charm or entertainment value.

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",

The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it.

Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate.

I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring.

Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",

Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree.

The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a film that was once considered pornographic but is now appreciated for its artistic approach to depicting sex and nudity within the context of Swedish cinema.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's exploration of sex and nudity is done in a tasteful and artistic manner, rather than for mere shock value. It offers a unique perspective on Swedish cinema and its cultural attitudes towards sexuality.",

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.

Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "review": "Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have focused heavily on 3D effects and gore, that can be appealing to certain audiences looking for a thrilling experience. The visuals and shock factor of flesh-eating zombies in 3D could be entertaining for fans of the genre who enjoy that kind of spectacle."

Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have its flaws such as the lack of nudity and continuity errors, the criticism towards the 3D effects seems exaggerated. The reviewer's personal preference for the actress playing the daughter may also skew their overall judgment of the film."

Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it.

Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life.

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible.

To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",

Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "Jill Dunne, played by Mitzi Kapture, is portrayed as an attractive woman overwhelmed by her self-centered daughter and husband. The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The characters were indeed obnoxious and the pacing of the film was slow. The lack of intensity in the stalking and storm elements was disappointing, and the constant bickering among the family members made it hard to root for any of them.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the characters may have been flawed, their dynamics and conflicts added depth to the story. The slow build-up to the storm and stalking created suspense, and the family's dysfunction felt realistic.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling.

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight.

Awful simply awful.",

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life.

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible.

I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

  "review": "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "Jill Dunne, played by Mitzi Kapture, is portrayed as an attractive woman overwhelmed by her self-centered daughter and husband. The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The characters were indeed obnoxious and the pacing of the film was slow. The lack of intensity in the stalking and storm elements was disappointing, and the constant bickering among the family members made it hard to root for any of them.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the characters may have been flawed, their dynamics and conflicts added depth to the story. The slow build-up to the storm and stalking created suspense, and the family's dysfunction felt realistic.

Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was a disaster from start to finish. The lackluster acting, nonsensical plot, and absurd character decisions made it unbearable to watch. It's frustrating when a film fails to deliver on even the most basic storytelling elements. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been a masterpiece, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' sense of helplessness added to the suspense. The setting of the campsite and the woods provided a creepy atmosphere that kept me engaged. While the plot had its flaws, I was able to overlook them and appreciate the film for what it was - a decent thriller with some thrilling moments."

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film.

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'.

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall. It's possible that some viewers may appreciate certain aspects of the film that the reviewer overlooked. I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

  "review": "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.

I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment of the editing in the movie. The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the reviewer's concerns about the editing, I have to disagree with the notion that the movie lacked a center. I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",

Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",

It's frustrating when a film fails to deliver on even the most basic storytelling elements. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been a masterpiece, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' sense of helplessness added to the suspense.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",

The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

  "review": "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged.

John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles. The film was a complete disaster from start to finish, filled with unnecessary filler, poor acting, and lackluster zombie action. The amateurish camera work and outdated production quality only added to the overall disappointment. It's clear that the movie failed to,

  "review": "Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

  "review": "I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment of the editing in the movie. The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the reviewer's concerns about the editing, I have to disagree with the notion that the movie lacked a center. I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

  "review": "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",

Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",

It's frustrating when a film fails to deliver on even the most basic storytelling elements. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.",

The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' sense of helplessness added to the suspense.

The story, though familiar, still had some suspenseful moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I thought the acting, particularly by the adult actors, was decent enough to carry the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a complete waste of time."

The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",

The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

It's important to recognize the value of storytelling in films and avoid creating aimless projects in the future.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry.

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. This movie sounds like a complete disaster from start to finish. The lack of production value, poor acting, and nonsensical plot make it seem like a waste of time and resources. It's disappointing to see such low-quality films being made and distributed.",
  "disagree": "I have to disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, it's important to remember that filmmaking is a creative process that can vary in quality. Just because a movie has a low budget or amateur actors doesn't automatically make it bad. Sometimes these types of films can surprise viewers with their unique storytelling or charm. It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

  "review": "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience. The 3-D format being wasted adds to the overall sense of dissatisfaction. Viewers deserve better than this kind of unimaginative and poorly executed film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles.

To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment of the editing in the movie. The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing.

Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky.

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "review": "Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have focused heavily on 3D effects and gore, that can be appealing to certain audiences looking for a thrilling experience. The visuals and shock factor of flesh-eating zombies in 3D could be entertaining for fans of the genre who enjoy that kind of spectacle."

  "review": "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",
  "agree": "I agree with the review. The lack of nudity, the anachronistic car choice, and the poor stereoscopic 3D effects all detract from the overall viewing experience of the movie. It's disappointing when these elements are not executed well in a film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have its flaws such as the lack of nudity and continuity errors, the criticism towards the 3D effects seems exaggerated. The reviewer's personal preference for the actress playing the daughter may also skew their overall judgment of the film."

The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams 'seriously, you could do better yourself'. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes' films have consistently disappointed with their lackluster storytelling and poor production quality. The criticism of the acting and overall presentation of the film is spot on. It's disheartening to see such uninspired work being put out into the world.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the criticisms leveled at Brad Sykes and his films, I believe there is still value in exploring different perspectives on zombie-related content. Not every film needs to be a masterpiece to have its own charm or entertainment value. Additionally, some viewers may appreciate the low-budget aesthetic and find enjoyment in the campiness of such productions."

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling. overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.",

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",

The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'.

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired.

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience.

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate.

I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch.

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",

The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era.

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier.

  "review": "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "Jill Dunne, played by Mitzi Kapture, is portrayed as an attractive woman overwhelmed by her self-centered daughter and husband. The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The characters were indeed obnoxious and the pacing of the film was slow. The lack of intensity in the stalking and storm elements was disappointing, and the constant bickering among the family members made it hard to root for any of them.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the characters may have been flawed, their dynamics and conflicts added depth to the story. The slow build-up to the storm and stalking created suspense, and the family's dysfunction felt realistic. The film's focus on relationships and moral dilemmas made it engaging and thought-provoking."

  "review": "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was a disaster from start to finish. The lackluster acting, nonsensical plot, and absurd character decisions made it unbearable to watch. It's frustrating when a film fails to deliver on even the most basic storytelling elements. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been a masterpiece, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' sense of helplessness added to the suspense. The setting of the campsite and the woods provided a creepy atmosphere that kept me engaged. While the plot had its flaws, I was able to overlook them and appreciate the film for what it was - a decent thriller with some thrilling moments."

Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed a disappointment. The plot was weak, the acting subpar, and the overall experience felt like a waste of time. I too was looking forward to a good thriller but was let down by this film. It's unfortunate that Lifetime continues to churn out movies like this, lacking in originality and quality.",

The story, though familiar, still had some suspenseful moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I thought the acting, particularly by the adult actors, was decent enough to carry the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a complete waste of time."

And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
  "agree": "I completely understand where you're coming from. The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well. Deedee Pfieffer's performance may have fallen short and detracted from the overall viewing experience. It's disappointing when a movie with potential ends up feeling disappointing and unengaging.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found the movie to be quite enjoyable. I appreciated the unique concept of the mother getting visions from touching objects and thought it added an intriguing element to the story. I also found Deedee Pfieffer's performance to be engaging and thought she brought depth to her character. The supporting cast also impressed me with their performances, making the movie more compelling. It's understandable that not every movie resonates with everyone, but in this case, I found the movie to be entertaining and engaging."

  "review": "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's exploration of sex and nudity is done in a tasteful and artistic manner, rather than for mere shock value. It offers a unique perspective on Swedish cinema and its cultural attitudes towards sexuality.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film doesn't have much of a plot. While the focus may be on the exploration of sex and politics, Lena's journey to understand life and society provides a compelling narrative thread that drives the film forward."

{
  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While it may touch on important issues, the lack of a clear motive makes it a challenging watch. It's important to recognize the value of storytelling in films and avoid creating aimless projects in the future.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it.

So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall. It's possible that some viewers may appreciate certain aspects of the film that the reviewer overlooked. I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

  "review": "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.

It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre.

Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",

Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",

The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",

The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of the film. While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience. The portrayal of the harsh Australian bush and the historical context added depth to the story, even if it may not have fully satisfied expectations. Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. This movie sounds like a complete disaster from start to finish. The lack of production value, poor acting, and nonsensical plot make it seem like a waste of time and resources. It's disappointing to see such low-quality films being made and distributed.",
  "disagree": "I have to disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, it's important to remember that filmmaking is a creative process that can vary in quality. Just because a movie has a low budget or amateur actors doesn't automatically make it bad. Sometimes these types of films can surprise viewers with their unique storytelling or charm. It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

  "review": "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience. The 3-D format being wasted adds to the overall sense of dissatisfaction. Viewers deserve better than this kind of unimaginative and poorly executed film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles.

To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment of the editing in the movie. The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre.

Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of the film. While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience. The portrayal of the harsh Australian bush and the historical context added depth to the story, even if it may not have fully satisfied expectations. Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film failed to capture the depth and complexity of Ned Kelly as a historical figure. The script was lackluster, the pacing was off, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. It's disappointing when a story with such rich potential is reduced to a shallow and unimpressive portrayal on screen.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have its flaws, it's important to appreciate the effort put into bringing Ned Kelly's story to the screen. The actors may have had limitations, but they still managed to deliver passable performances. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex and controversial figure can spark discussions and interpretations, even if the execution may not have been perfect."

  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film doesn't have much of a plot. While the focus may be on the exploration of sex and politics, Lena's journey to understand life and society provides a compelling narrative thread that drives the film forward."

{
  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

    "disagree": "I disagree with the review as I believe that experimental films have their place in the industry. While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

While acknowledging the strengths of realistic acting and impressive cinematography, I believe that the portrayal of silliness and the actress's performance could be interpreted differently.

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again.

This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice.

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight.

Awful simply awful.",

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life.

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible.

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

  "review": "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre.

The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",

  "review": "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was a disaster from start to finish. The lackluster acting, nonsensical plot, and absurd character decisions made it unbearable to watch. It's frustrating when a film fails to deliver on even the most basic storytelling elements. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been a masterpiece, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' sense of helplessness added to the suspense. The setting of the campsite and the woods provided a creepy atmosphere that kept me engaged. While the plot had its flaws, I was able to overlook them and appreciate the film for what it was - a decent thriller with some thrilling moments."

Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",

It may not be a masterpiece, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a complete waste of time."

And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
  "agree": "I completely understand where you're coming from. The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well. Deedee Pfieffer's performance may have fallen short and detracted from the overall viewing experience. It's disappointing when a movie with potential ends up feeling disappointing and unengaging.",

I appreciated the unique concept of the mother getting visions from touching objects and thought it added an intriguing element to the story. I also found Deedee Pfieffer's performance to be engaging and thought she brought depth to her character. The supporting cast also impressed me with their performances, making the movie more compelling.

  "review": "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of the film. While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience. The portrayal of the harsh Australian bush and the historical context added depth to the story, even if it may not have fully satisfied expectations. Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film failed to capture the depth and complexity of Ned Kelly as a historical figure. The script was lackluster, the pacing was off, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. It's disappointing when a story with such rich potential is reduced to a shallow and unimpressive portrayal on screen.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have its flaws, it's important to appreciate the effort put into bringing Ned Kelly's story to the screen. The actors may have had limitations, but they still managed to deliver passable performances. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex and controversial figure can spark discussions and interpretations, even if the execution may not have been perfect."

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

  "review": "It's not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well.

If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood.

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience. The 3-D format being wasted adds to the overall sense of dissatisfaction. Viewers deserve better than this kind of unimaginative and poorly executed film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles.

To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing.

Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",

The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",

While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",

While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience. The portrayal of the harsh Australian bush and the historical context added depth to the story, even if it may not have fully satisfied expectations. Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film failed to capture the depth and complexity of Ned Kelly as a historical figure. The script was lackluster, the pacing was off, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. It's disappointing when a story with such rich potential is reduced to a shallow and unimpressive portrayal on screen.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have its flaws, it's important to appreciate the effort put into bringing Ned Kelly's story to the screen. The actors may have had limitations, but they still managed to deliver passable performances. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex and controversial figure can spark discussions and interpretations, even if the execution may not have been perfect."

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people). This is a turgid, emotion,

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",

The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters.

They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.

I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

  "review": "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre.

Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",

Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",

The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.

The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",

While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience.

Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",

Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen.

MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

It's understandable why the reviewer suggests avoiding it altogether.",

There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film sounds like a pretentious mess that tries too hard to be edgy and provocative but fails miserably. The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources. Even amateur filmmakers can bring fresh perspectives and creativity to their projects, and sometimes the charm of a low-budget film lies in its raw and unpolished nature. While this particular film may not have hit the mark,

And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling. overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the film may not be the best in terms of storyline or overall quality, it does have a certain charm that makes it enjoyable to watch, especially for cheap laughs. Jebidia's performance was a standout and added to the entertainment value of the movie.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may have provided some cheap laughs and entertainment value, I found the storyline to be too lacking and the overall quality too low to justify watching it multiple times. Jebidia's performance may have been good, but I don't believe it was Oscar-worthy."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk. It inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, making the zombie attacks predictable. The film is filled with continuity mistakes and diabolical acting, making it unbearable to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The film's poor technical execution, lack of originality, and predictable nature make it a painful viewing experience. The amateurish acting and continuity errors only add to the overall disappointment. It's definitely a film to avoid.",

The over-the-top acting and continuity mistakes can be seen as part of the charm of low-budget horror films. Despite its shortcomings, it can be enjoyed for its campy appeal."

  "review": "I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie are going to be bad. After not watching it for more than a year I finally watched it. What a pathetic movie. I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. This movie sounds like a complete disaster from start to finish. The lack of production value, poor acting, and nonsensical plot make it seem like a waste of time and resources. It's disappointing to see such low-quality films being made and distributed.",
  "disagree": "I have to disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, it's important to remember that filmmaking is a creative process that can vary in quality. Just because a movie has a low budget or amateur actors doesn't automatically make it bad. Sometimes these types of films can surprise viewers with their unique storytelling or charm. It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

  "review": "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience. The 3-D format being wasted adds to the overall sense of dissatisfaction. Viewers deserve better than this kind of unimaginative and poorly executed film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles.

To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",

I too was looking forward to a good thriller but was let down by this film. It's unfortunate that Lifetime continues to churn out movies like this, lacking in originality and quality.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been groundbreaking or exceptional, I found it to be entertaining in its own right. The story, though familiar, still had some suspenseful moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I thought the acting, particularly by the adult actors, was decent enough to carry the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a complete waste of time."

  "review": "I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets 'visions' when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
  "agree": "I completely understand where you're coming from. The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well. Deedee Pfieffer's performance may have fallen short and detracted from the overall viewing experience. It's disappointing when a movie with potential ends up feeling disappointing and unengaging.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found the movie to be quite enjoyable. I appreciated the unique concept of the mother getting visions from touching objects and thought it added an intriguing element to the story. I also found Deedee Pfieffer's performance to be engaging and thought she brought depth to her character. The supporting cast also impressed me with their performances, making the movie more compelling. It's understandable that not every movie resonates with everyone, but in this case, I found the movie to be entertaining and engaging."

  "review": "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",

While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience. The portrayal of the harsh Australian bush and the historical context added depth to the story, even if it may not have fully satisfied expectations. Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film failed to capture the depth and complexity of Ned Kelly as a historical figure. The script was lackluster, the pacing was off, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. It's disappointing when a story with such rich potential is reduced to a shallow and unimpressive portrayal on screen.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have its flaws, it's important to appreciate the effort put into bringing Ned Kelly's story to the screen. The actors may have had limitations, but they still managed to deliver passable performances. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex and controversial figure can spark discussions and interpretations, even if the execution may not have been perfect."

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people). This is a turgid, emotion,

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",

The historical inaccuracies and lack of depth in character development were disappointing. I also had higher expectations based on the novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' and was let down by the film's execution. The comparison to Mick Jagger's portrayal being closer to reality is telling of the movie's shortcomings.

With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was. I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free.

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release.

Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",

The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters.

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

  "review": "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

  "review": "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie. The comparison to 'Star 80' and the praise for 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' highlight the importance of strong performances and storytelling in cinema.",

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

  "review": "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",
  "disagree": "While the review paints a grim picture of the movie, I believe there may still be some redeeming qualities to be found. Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I would be curious to watch it myself and form my own opinion before completely writing it off as a 'suckotrocity'."

Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems.

  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review of The Zombie Chronicles.

To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film. The storyline, though flawed, had some intriguing moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I found the cinematography to be visually appealing in certain scenes. While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",

Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",

The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",

While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",

While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience.

Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The portrayal of Ned Kelly in this movie seemed more like a fantasy than a serious attempt at depicting his true story. The historical inaccuracies and lack of depth in character development were disappointing. I also had higher expectations based on the novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' and was let down by the film's execution. The comparison to Mick Jagger's portrayal being closer to reality is telling of the movie's shortcomings. The scenic shots were a redeeming quality, but overall, the film fell short of capturing the essence of Ned Kelly's story.",

While the movie may have taken some creative liberties in its portrayal of Ned Kelly, I believe that artistic creativity is essential in bringing historical figures to life on screen.

I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was. I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",

The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",

While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.

They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",

There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set.

It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.

I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had potential with great actors/actresses, but the excessive subplots and confusing dialogue made it hard to stay engaged. It's disappointing when a film with such talent falls short of expectations, especially in the case of Audrey Hepburn's last movie. John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",
  "disagree": "While I respect the reviewer's opinion, I found the movie to be captivating despite the multiple subplots. The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along. The dialogue may have been stiff at times, but I believe it added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, I thought John Ritter's portrayal brought a different dimension to his acting abilities, showing versatility beyond just slapstick comedy."

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

  "review": "If the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. In a 'Twist Ending'-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",

And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well.

The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.

I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.

Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be.

This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.

I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

  "review": "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

  "review": "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre.

Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",

Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",

The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.

The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well.

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design.

While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience.

Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",

Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience.

The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad.

Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen. The critique of the alleged double standard in nudity portrayal is thought-provoking and sheds light on societal norms and biases.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the film is a 'steaming pile' and cannot be taken seriously. While the discussion on nudity in films is relevant, the harsh criticism of the movie may overlook any potential artistic or political messages it aims to convey. The argument about the anatomical differences between male and female nudity, while factual, does not necessarily diminish the film's value or intent."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",

While this particular film may not have resonated with everyone, it's essential to push boundaries and explore new ways of storytelling. Experimental films can spark discussions and encourage viewers to think outside the box, even if they don't follow traditional narrative structures."

    "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film seems to have garnered attention more for its controversy rather than its actual content.

The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",

While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",

The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies without a strong underlying story made the movie a bore. The classics had a better balance between story and gore, and this movie failed to capture that essence.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have focused heavily on 3D effects and gore, that can be appealing to certain audiences looking for a thrilling experience. The visuals and shock factor of flesh-eating zombies in 3D could be entertaining for fans of the genre who enjoy that kind of spectacle."

  "review": "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",
  "agree": "I agree with the review. The lack of nudity, the anachronistic car choice, and the poor stereoscopic 3D effects all detract from the overall viewing experience of the movie. It's disappointing when these elements are not executed well in a film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have its flaws such as the lack of nudity and continuity errors, the criticism towards the 3D effects seems exaggerated. The reviewer's personal preference for the actress playing the daughter may also skew their overall judgment of the film."

The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams 'seriously, you could do better yourself'. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes' films have consistently disappointed with their lackluster storytelling and poor production quality. The criticism of the acting and overall presentation of the film is spot on. It's disheartening to see such uninspired work being put out into the world.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the criticisms leveled at Brad Sykes and his films, I believe there is still value in exploring different perspectives on zombie-related content. Not every film needs to be a masterpiece to have its own charm or entertainment value.

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms raised about the poor acting, amateur camera work, unimaginative special effects, lack of plot and character development, and overall low quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a film fails to deliver even on a basic level, and in this case, it seems like the filmmaker has not improved over time despite making multiple films. The reviewer's frustration with the lack of growth and quality in Brad Sykes' work is understandable, and I share the sentiment that this film falls short of being a worthwhile watch.",

While the criticisms about the acting, camera work, and special effects may be valid, there is still value in recognizing the effort put into creating a film, especially with limited resources.

I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",

It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",

The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",

The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged.

I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",

Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",

While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it.

Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate.

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",

The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring.

Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",

The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",

Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier.

The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and the alien encounters to be intriguing. The film's focus on these elements added a unique and creative twist to the typical horror genre. Additionally, the chaotic ending and mysterious plot kept me engaged throughout the movie, making it an interesting watch despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "Jill Dunne, played by Mitzi Kapture, is portrayed as an attractive woman overwhelmed by her self-centered daughter and husband. The movie's advertised premise of a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a storm falls short as the storm and intense stalking only happen towards the end. Most of the film is spent on arguments and whining, making it frustrating to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The characters were indeed obnoxious and the pacing of the film was slow. The lack of intensity in the stalking and storm elements was disappointing, and the constant bickering among the family members made it hard to root for any of them.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the characters may have been flawed, their dynamics and conflicts added depth to the story. The slow build-up to the storm and stalking created suspense, and the family's dysfunction felt realistic. The film's focus on relationships and moral dilemmas made it engaging and thought-provoking."

  "review": "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was a disaster from start to finish. The lackluster acting, nonsensical plot, and absurd character decisions made it unbearable to watch. It's frustrating when a film fails to deliver on even the most basic storytelling elements. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been a masterpiece, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' sense of helplessness added to the suspense.

While the plot had its flaws, I was able to overlook them and appreciate the film for what it was - a decent thriller with some thrilling moments."

Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",

The story, though familiar, still had some suspenseful moments that kept me engaged. Additionally, I thought the acting, particularly by the adult actors, was decent enough to carry the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a complete waste of time."

And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",

The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions from touching things may not have been executed well. Deedee Pfieffer's performance may have fallen short and detracted from the overall viewing experience. It's disappointing when a movie with potential ends up feeling disappointing and unengaging.",

The supporting cast also impressed me with their performances, making the movie more compelling.

  "review": "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",

While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience.

Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film failed to capture the depth and complexity of Ned Kelly as a historical figure. The script was lackluster, the pacing was off, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. It's disappointing when a story with such rich potential is reduced to a shallow and unimpressive portrayal on screen.",

The actors may have had limitations, but they still managed to deliver passable performances. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex and controversial figure can spark discussions and interpretations, even if the execution may not have been perfect."

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people). This is a turgid, emotion,

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",

The historical inaccuracies and lack of depth in character development were disappointing. I also had higher expectations based on the novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' and was let down by the film's execution. The comparison to Mick Jagger's portrayal being closer to reality is telling of the movie's shortcomings.

With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience.

The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",

As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is pretentious and lacks substance. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, highlighting the cultural differences and limitations when it comes to depicting female anatomy on screen.

The criticisms of the poor quality in terms of cinematography, sound, and overall execution make it clear that this is not a film worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea and may have its flaws, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. Sometimes, films that challenge the norms and push boundaries can be polarizing but still hold value in sparking important discussions and reflections."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball contains so many factual errors. The lack of attention to detail and accuracy in portraying her life is a disservice to her legacy.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. It's important to remember that not everything in a biopic will be 100% accurate, and sometimes artistic interpretation is necessary to make the story more engaging for audiences."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball and Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz were disappointing. The casting choices did not do justice to the iconic roles of Lucy and Ricky. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in other media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie. The lack of resemblance in looks, talent, and authenticity in the performances took away from the overall viewing experience.",

    "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular,

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as a vanity project for Peter Bogdonavitch, with characters that feel disconnected from reality. The focus on millionaire playboy detectives dating beautiful models does make it hard for the average viewer to relate to the story and characters. The convoluted plot and the forced inclusion of certain characters only add to the confusion and lack of engagement for the audience. It's clear that the filmmaker's personal experiences may have clouded his ability to create a more universally appealing film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the film. While it may be true that the characters and storyline are not relatable to everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The fact that Peter Bogdonavitch drew from his own life experiences to create this film can add a layer of authenticity and depth to the story. The inclusion of real-life models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson could be seen as a tribute or a way to explore certain themes,

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. While it was nice to see some beloved stars from the past, the lack of character development and meaningful dialogue made it hard to stay engaged with the film. The smaller female roles showed potential, but overall, the movie fell short of expectations.",

While the film may not have lived up to the reviewer's expectations, I found the nostalgic presence of John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn to be a highlight. Additionally, the comedic elements and romantic entanglements added a fun twist to the detective agency storyline, making it an enjoyable watch for me."

I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",

Bob Fosse's 'Star 80' about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful 'poodlesque' hair-do....Very disappointing....'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer's sentiment that casting models and Playboy bunnies in films can sometimes detract from the overall quality and depth of the movie.

Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the cast and setting were exceptional, the lack of a strong script really detracted from the overall impact of the film. The characters falling in love at first sight without much depth or development made it hard to connect with their journey.",

While the script may have been lacking in traditional dialogue, the director's choice to focus on visual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors could have been a deliberate artistic choice. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words, and the film's message could have been conveyed through subtle nuances and emotions rather than explicit dialogue."

  "review": "Today I found 'They All Laughed' on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in 'Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003' and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching 'They All Laughed' and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in 'Star 80' and 'Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story'; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song 'Amigo', from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as 'The King'. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Muito Riso e Muita Alegria' ('Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness')",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with poor performances, bad editing, and an overall lackluster plot. It's disappointing to hear that even talented actors like John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten couldn't save this film from being a trainwreck. The reviewer's strong warning to avoid watching it at all costs seems justified based on the laundry list of flaws mentioned.",

Sometimes films that receive harsh criticism can still offer moments of entertainment or artistic value, even if they are flawed overall.

I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",

John Ritter's performance was also a letdown compared to his usual comedic brilliance.",

The complexity added depth to the story for me, and I appreciated the challenge of following along.

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps,

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The opening credits revealing every death in a 'Twist Ending'-type movie definitely takes away the element of surprise. Hiring better actors who can deliver believable performances is essential for any film to be engaging. Setting a movie in the past without accurate props and costumes can break the immersion for the audience. Signposting the twist too early can ruin the impact of the reveal. These are all valid points that the crew behind 'Zombie Chronicles' should consider for future projects.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the valid criticisms raised in the review, I have to disagree with the overall sentiment. Despite the flaws mentioned, the effort put into creating 'Zombie Chronicles' on a limited budget should be appreciated. Sometimes, low-budget productions face challenges in terms of casting and resources, but that doesn't diminish the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. The twist endings, even if slightly predictable, can still add an element of intrigue for viewers. As a fan of zombie movies, I believe 'Zombie Chronicles' could still hold value for enthusiasts of the genre."

If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood.

  "review": "OK its not the best film I've ever seen but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!! story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way. And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling. overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While the film may not be the best in terms of storyline or overall quality, it does have a certain charm that makes it enjoyable to watch, especially for cheap laughs. Jebidia's performance was a standout and added to the entertainment value of the movie.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may have provided some cheap laughs and entertainment value, I found the storyline to be too lacking and the overall quality too low to justify watching it multiple times. Jebidia's performance may have been good, but I don't believe it was Oscar-worthy."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk. It inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, making the zombie attacks predictable. The film is filled with continuity mistakes and diabolical acting, making it unbearable to watch.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The film's poor technical execution, lack of originality, and predictable nature make it a painful viewing experience. The amateurish acting and continuity errors only add to the overall disappointment. It's definitely a film to avoid.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While The Zombie Chronicles may have its flaws, it still offers some entertainment value for fans of bad movies. The over-the-top acting and continuity mistakes can be seen as part of the charm of low-budget horror films. Despite its shortcomings, it can be enjoyed for its campy appeal."

  "review": "I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie are going to be bad. After not watching it for more than a year I finally watched it. What a pathetic movie. I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie. Trust me when I say 'this movie sucks.' I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wannabe got even financed to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't have cost more than $20,000 to produce this movie. All you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera, about 15 people with no acting skills, and a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra bad movie, a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed drunk man over on her way to report on a haunted town. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed abandoned house, but luckily for them, it is almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep happens to be there, just for the supposed drunk man, but all is not what it seems. Then the supposed drunk man starts telling Tara ghost/zombie stories. The first of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. This movie sounds like a complete disaster from start to finish. The lack of production value, poor acting, and nonsensical plot make it seem like a waste of time and resources. It's disappointing to see such low-quality films being made and distributed.",
  "disagree": "I have to disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, it's important to remember that filmmaking is a creative process that can vary in quality. Just because a movie has a low budget or amateur actors doesn't automatically make it bad. Sometimes these types of films can surprise viewers with their unique storytelling or charm. It's possible that this movie, despite its shortcomings, could still have some redeeming qualities worth exploring."

  "review": "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed poorly acted, with the main character lacking depth and the storyline being unimpressive. The over-the-top portrayal of the army guy was cringeworthy, and the overall quality of the film was subpar. It felt like a waste of time and resources, and I also found myself watching it just to see how bad it could get.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found some redeeming qualities in it. The makeup and production design were commendable, and I appreciated the effort put into those aspects. Additionally, I thought the storyline, although not perfect, had some intriguing elements that kept me engaged. While the acting may not have been top-notch, I believe there were moments of authenticity that added some depth to the characters. Overall, I don't think it deserves the title of the worst movie ever."

  "review": "This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like 'continuity editing' and 'geographic match'. I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie's lack of continuity and confusing time periods can be off-putting for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative. The criticism of the acting being subpar is also valid, as strong performances are crucial for engaging storytelling.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the movie's only appeal lies in being a 'b-movie' or a 'BAD movie'. While the film may not cater to fans of Goddard and Antonioni, there could still be merit in its unconventional style and approach for audiences seeking a different cinematic experience."

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and his ability to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to deliver something interesting for the audience to appreciate.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While Brad Sykes may have some interesting ideas and characters in his films, the lack of funds and overall execution often leave much to be desired. Continuously churning out budget horror films without significant improvement may not necessarily warrant admiration, especially if the end result fails to resonate with the audience."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The amateurish performance, routine stories, and lackluster direction make this movie a frustrating and disappointing experience. The 3-D format being wasted adds to the overall sense of dissatisfaction. Viewers deserve better than this kind of unimaginative and poorly executed film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as amateurish performances and routine storytelling, I believe that there are still elements of entertainment value in it. The concept of flesh-eating zombies haunting a ghost town could have potential, and some viewers may find enjoyment in the film despite its shortcomings. Additionally, the use of the 3-D format, even if not fully utilized, could still add some visual interest to the viewing experience."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise. And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date! If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10 P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",

To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie. As a fellow zombie fanatic, I had high hopes for it as well, but it fell short of expectations. The few moments that stood out were not enough to redeem the overall experience. It's frustrating when a film with potential fails to deliver on its promises.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I actually found some redeeming qualities in the movie. The scene where the guy's head gets ripped off was indeed intense and well-executed, showcasing the horror elements that many zombie fans appreciate. Additionally, I believe the film's lack of gratuitous nudity can be seen as a positive, as it allowed the focus to remain on the story and characters rather than relying on cheap thrills."

  "review": "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with your assessment of this movie. It was truly a terrible experience, and the inaccuracies in the flashback scene were just one of many issues that made it unbearable to watch. I also found myself questioning why such a poorly made film was even available for rental. It's a shame that you had to endure it, and I share your sentiment that it remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion on the movie, I actually found some redeeming qualities in it. Yes, the flashback scene with the anachronistic elements was jarring, but I was able to overlook that and appreciate other aspects of the film.

While it may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Love's Abiding Joy was disappointing. The movie did feel sad and lacking in emotion, and the departure from the original book's storyline was noticeable. The editing issues and lack of coherence in some scenes were also apparent. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were jarring. I share the sentiment that the script should have stayed closer to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future adaptations will address these concerns and stay true to the source material.",

  "review": "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. It's disappointing when a movie adaptation strays so far from the source material. In this case, it seems like a disservice to both the author and the fans of the book. The lack of adherence to the original plot and character details can really take away from the overall experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the frustration of deviations from the book, I believe that adaptations can sometimes take creative liberties to appeal to a wider audience or enhance the storytelling visually. As long as the core themes and messages of the book are preserved, a different interpretation can still be enjoyable in its own right."

Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

The disjointed scenes and lack of a cohesive narrative structure definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience. A more polished editing job would have greatly improved the storytelling and engagement with the characters.",

I found the story of Willie and Missy to be engaging and their characters to be strong role models. The love story aspect added depth to the plot and kept me invested in the film. Despite the editing issues, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and a good addition to the series."

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation not staying true to the book. It can be frustrating when key elements are changed or omitted, leading to a disconnect for fans who were expecting a faithful adaptation. The deviation from the original story can indeed impact the overall viewing experience and leave a sense of dissatisfaction.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the movie adaptation not aligning with the book, I found the film to be a poignant and realistic portrayal of pioneer life. The emotional depth and challenges faced by the characters added a layer of authenticity to the narrative, showcasing the harsh realities of that era. While deviations from the book may be disappointing, I believe the movie succeeded in capturing the essence of family values and resilience, making it a compelling watch."

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The film does fall short in terms of production quality and storytelling. It's important for Christian filmmakers to strive for excellence in their work to truly capture the essence of their faith. Turning to literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration could indeed elevate the genre and offer more depth to future projects.",
  "disagree": "While 'Love's Abiding Joy' may not have met your expectations, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of filmmakers in the Christian genre. Creating movies that cater to a specific audience can be challenging, and while this film may have its flaws, it still serves a purpose in providing wholesome entertainment for those seeking faith-based content. Every genre has its share of low-budget productions, and it's through constructive criticism that filmmakers can improve and deliver more impactful stories in the future."

  "review": "With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer,

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The movie's plot was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the killer's weapon was not enough to carry the film. Despite the solid cast, the script failed to deliver a compelling story and the alien encounters felt underdeveloped. The movie seemed to rely too heavily on the novelty of the weapon rather than building a coherent narrative.",

Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that this episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to set the TV series in the 1930s for audience appeal, despite the original book being in the 1950s, may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the inclusion of elements like the 1950s train disguised as a 1930s train and the weak plotline about the Jarrow March felt like attempts to fill time rather than enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the assessment that the episode was a victim of style over content. While the decision to adapt the setting to the 1930s may have been for stylistic reasons, it could have added a unique visual appeal to the series. Furthermore, exploring themes like poverty and social awareness through the Jarrow March plotline could have provided a relevant and thought-provoking commentary, even if it deviated from the original book's timeline. The inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself could have added depth to the characters and their experiences."

  "review": "The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason. There were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The unnecessary elements like the annoying mouse and lullaby did not add anything to the story and seemed out of place. The pacing of the movie was definitely off, and it felt like the story was dragging on with no clear direction.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While I can understand the frustration with certain elements, I believe that the creative team may have been trying to add depth and layers to the story. Sometimes, movies that take risks with unconventional elements can be polarizing but can also offer a unique viewing experience."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film had an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger and some positive aspects like support acting from Edgerton and production design. However, I also agree that the plot was lacking depth and failed to fully capture the essence of Ned Kelly as a folk hero. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falls short of delivering a compelling narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of the film. While I acknowledge that the plot may have been thin, I believe that the strong performances by Ledger, Edgerton, and the rest of the cast, along with the immersive production design, still made it an engaging viewing experience. The portrayal of the harsh Australian bush and the historical context added depth to the story, even if it may not have fully satisfied expectations. Overall, I think the film deserves more credit for its strengths despite its shortcomings."

  "review": "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film failed to capture the depth and complexity of Ned Kelly as a historical figure. The script was lackluster, the pacing was off, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. It's disappointing when a story with such rich potential is reduced to a shallow and unimpressive portrayal on screen.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have its flaws, it's important to appreciate the effort put into bringing Ned Kelly's story to the screen. The actors may have had limitations, but they still managed to deliver passable performances. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex and controversial figure can spark discussions and interpretations, even if the execution may not have been perfect."

  "review": "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called 'facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, 'Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version. Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel 'real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and 'Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people). This is a turgid, emotion,

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The portrayal of Ned Kelly in this movie seemed more like a fantasy than a serious attempt at depicting his true story. The historical inaccuracies and lack of depth in character development were disappointing. I also had higher expectations based on the novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' and was let down by the film's execution. The comparison to Mick Jagger's portrayal being closer to reality is telling of the movie's shortcomings. The scenic shots were a redeeming quality, but overall, the film fell short of capturing the essence of Ned Kelly's story.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have taken some creative liberties in its portrayal of Ned Kelly, I believe that artistic creativity is essential in bringing historical figures to life on screen. The blending of genres like fantasy and western can add an interesting twist to a familiar story. Additionally, the fact that there are both myths and,

  "review": "This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while. Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was. I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",
  "agree": "I completely understand where you're coming from. The film fell short in so many aspects, from the casting choices to the lackluster plot. It's disappointing when a movie with such potential turns out to be a letdown. The humor you found in the final scenes highlights the unintentional absurdity of the film, adding to the overall sense of disappointment.",

The performances by Rachel Griffiths and the rest of the cast, despite some criticisms, added depth to their characters. The film's exploration of complex themes like morality and redemption, even if flawed, offered some thought-provoking moments,

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While 'Ned Kelly' may have historical significance, it falls short in terms of providing engaging entertainment. The film relies heavily on clichés and fails to bring anything new or compelling to the table.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of 'Ned Kelly.' While the film may draw on familiar tropes of the 'gentleman bandit' genre, it still manages to capture the essence of a folk hero figure in Australian history. The portrayal of Ned Kelly as a complex character, along with the historical context provided, adds depth to the narrative."

    "review": "This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",

  "review": "This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one. Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Despite the talented actors in the movie, it was indeed a disappointment. The slow pace and lack of character development made it hard to stay engaged, and I also found myself struggling to connect with the story. I regret renting it and would not recommend it to others.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may not have lived up to the expectations set by the cast, I found some value in their performances. The film's slower pace allowed for a deeper exploration of the characters, and I appreciated the nuanced portrayals by Bloom, Ledger, and Rush. While it may not be a blockbuster, I believe there are still aspects of the movie that could be appreciated by those looking for a more introspective viewing experience."

  "review": "I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical. The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap. I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.",

While the movie may have had its flaws, adding a shootout for the sake of action could have detracted from the storytelling and character development. Additionally, comparing it to the Mick Jagger version may not be a fair assessment as each adaptation brings its own interpretation to the story."
