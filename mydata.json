  "review": "I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered 'controversial' I really had to see this for myself. The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men. What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer that I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW, despite its controversial reputation, does not rely solely on explicit content for shock value. The film's approach to depicting sex and nudity for artistic purposes rather than exploitation is commendable. Additionally, the exploration of Swedish cinema's cultural context and the portrayal of political issues through the lens of a young drama student provide valuable insights into the era in which the film was made.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the reviewer's assessment that I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW lacks much of a plot. While the film may not follow a traditional narrative structure, its focus on the protagonist's journey of self-discovery and exploration of political issues offers a unique and thought-provoking storyline.

  "review": "I Am Curious: Yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) 'double-standard' in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. 'I Am Curious: Yellow' seems to be trying too hard to be provocative and meaningful, but ultimately falls flat. The comparison between male and female nudity in films is valid, and the lack of equal representation is a clear issue that needs to be addressed in the industry.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of 'I Am Curious: Yellow'. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea, dismissing it as a 'steaming pile' seems overly harsh. The discussion about nudity in films is important, but the argument that male nudity is more accepted than female nudity overlooks the broader context of societal norms and expectations surrounding gender and sexuality in cinema."

One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film). One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that this film lacks a coherent story and fails to provide any new perspectives. While it may touch on important issues, without a clear motive, it falls short of engaging the audience effectively. It's important to learn from this and avoid creating similar films in the future.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment that this film is entirely pointless. While it may be experimental and lack a traditional narrative structure, it could still hold value for certain viewers who appreciate unconventional storytelling. The film's exploration of important issues, even without a clear motive, can spark introspection and provoke thought, making it a worthwhile experience for some."

  "review": "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",

Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!! The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.",

There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film sounds like a pretentious and poorly executed attempt at art. The criticisms of the sex sequences, politics, cinematography, and sound all point to a lack of quality and coherence in the film. It's disappointing when a movie tries to be profound or controversial but fails to deliver on any level.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea, art is subjective and what one person sees as unwatchable trash, another may see as a thought-provoking and daring piece of cinema. The use of grainy black and white photography, out of focus scenes, and controversial politics could be intentional choices by the filmmaker to evoke a specific mood or message. Just because a film challenges traditional norms or aesthetics doesn't automatically make it bad."

  "review": "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. It's disappointing when a biopic about such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball fails to accurately portray her life and legacy. The lack of attention to detail and factual errors can really detract from the overall viewing experience. Lucille Ball's story is one that deserves to be told with accuracy and respect, and it's a shame when filmmakers miss the mark in capturing her essence.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with factual errors in the movie, I believe that biopics often take creative liberties to enhance the storytelling. It's important to remember that movies are not always meant to be entirely accurate representations of real-life events. The filmmakers may have chosen to focus on certain aspects of Lucille Ball's life for dramatic effect, even if it deviates from the exact truth. As long as the essence of her character and legacy are preserved, some inaccuracies can be forgiven in the name of artistic interpretation."

  "review": "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement. To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball in this movie was indeed awful, and it's disappointing that such an iconic figure like Lucille Ball was not given justice in the casting. The comparison to other portrayals of Lucy in different media further highlights the shortcomings of this movie's casting choices.",

  "review": "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular.

  "review": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does come across as self-indulgent and disconnected from the reality of most viewers. The characters and their lifestyles seem far removed from the average person's experiences, making it difficult for the audience to relate or engage with the story. The focus on glamorous models and millionaire playboys feels more like a fantasy world rather than a believable detective narrative. The lack of depth in the characters and the convoluted plot only add to the sense of detachment and boredom for the audience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While it's true that the film may reflect Peter Bogdonavitch's personal experiences and may not resonate with everyone, that doesn't necessarily make it a failure. The film's unique perspective and portrayal of characters living a lavish lifestyle could be seen as a deliberate artistic choice rather than a sign of being out of touch. The inclusion of real-life figures like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hanson adds an intriguing layer to the story, even if their roles may"},

  "review": "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film failed to fully utilize the talents of the veteran actors like John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn. Despite their presence, the characters lacked depth and compelling dialogue, making it hard to connect with the story.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment of the smaller female roles. While Patty Henson and Colleen Camp may have delivered competent performances, the reviewer underestimates the impact of their contributions to the film.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target.

Bob Fosse's \"Star 80\" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....Very disappointing....\"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" I could watch again and again.

There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in 'the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",

John Ritter doing prat falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

  "review": "I have this film out of the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow. Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you. 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves.' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road,' perhaps"},

I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you... 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time. 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the 'reveal' as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea. Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't... Only for zombie completists.",

Additionally, hiring actors who can deliver believable performances is crucial for any film to be engaging.

These are valid criticisms that the crew should take into consideration for future projects.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the points raised about the opening credits and the need for better acting are valid, I believe that low-budget productions can still be successful with creative storytelling and strong direction.

Additionally, signposting a twist ending early on can create anticipation and intrigue if executed well. Despite its flaws, 'Zombie Chronicles' may still have value for fans of the zombie genre."

That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The focus on mindless flesh-eating zombies in 3D did not add anything new or exciting to the genre. The lack of a compelling underlying story and slow pacing made the movie tedious to watch. I also believe that the original zombie classics had more depth and substance beyond just the gore.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may have relied heavily on the gimmick of 3D and flesh-eating zombies, it still provided some entertainment value for fans of the genre. The different storylines within the movie added variety and the use of 3D technology could have enhanced the viewing experience for some audience members. Despite its flaws, it may still appeal to those looking for a fun, mindless horror flick."

  "review": "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. This thing is a big ball of nothing. And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the lack of nudity in the movie was disappointing. It could have added an extra layer of authenticity or sensuality to the film. The criticism about the anachronistic use of a Kia Sportage in a scene set in 1971 is valid, as such inconsistencies can detract from the overall viewing experience. Additionally, the critique of the poor quality of the stereoscopic 3D effect is on point, as subpar visual effects can significantly diminish the enjoyment of a 3D movie.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's overall negative assessment of the movie. While the points raised about the lack of nudity, continuity errors, and poor 3D effects are valid criticisms, they do not necessarily make the entire film a 'big ball of nothing.' The reviewer's personal preference for more explicit content or specific visual effects does not necessarily reflect the quality of the storytelling, acting, or other aspects of the movie. Additionally, focusing solely on the appearance of certain actresses may overlook the broader cinematic elements at play."

  "review": "The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthology—a nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy, the locations are uninspired, the script is dreary, and the ending beggars belief.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review of The Zombie Chronicles. The film falls short in many aspects, from the lackluster acting to the uninspired locations and dreary script. The ending was particularly disappointing, and overall, the movie failed to deliver on its potential as a zombie-themed anthology. The positive aspects mentioned, such as the creative camera-work and enthusiastic gore effects, were not enough to salvage the film's shortcomings.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review of The Zombie Chronicles. While the film may have its flaws, such as the lousy acting and uninspired locations, I found the creative camera-work and enthusiastic gore effects to be redeeming qualities. The two stories presented, although limited in number, still managed to provide some entertainment value. Additionally, the film's low budget nature should be taken into consideration when evaluating its overall impact. I believe that The Zombie Chronicles deserves a slightly higher rating than 3/10."

The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams 'seriously, you could do better yourself'. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes' films have consistently disappointed me, and this one is no exception. The poor acting and low-quality production make it hard to sit through, and I also feel like my time was wasted watching it. It's definitely not worth the money, even at a discounted price.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the criticisms of this film, I have to respectfully disagree with the review. As a fan of low-budget horror movies, I found the campy nature of the film to be entertaining. The cheesy acting and shoddy production added to its charm for me, and I appreciated it for what it was. It may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it served its purpose as a fun, mindless watch for me."

  "review": "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera 'direction' needs serious reworking. And no more 'hold the camera and run' gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment). Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't. Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other 'home movies' (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a 'director' will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms of the acting, camera work, special effects, scenery, music, lack of plot and character development, and overall amateurish quality of the film are all valid points. It's disappointing when a low-budget film fails to deliver on even the basic aspects of filmmaking.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the film may have its flaws, it's important to appreciate the effort and creativity that goes into making amateur, low-budget films. Sometimes these films can surprise audiences with their unique storytelling or innovative approaches, even if they may not have the polish of big-budget productions. It's unfair to dismiss all amateur films as 'atrocities' without acknowledging the passion and dedication of the filmmakers."

  "review": "Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk. It's been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already. Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip. Awful, awful stuff. We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.",

While it may have its flaws, as most low-budget films do, there could still be some redeeming qualities or elements that make it enjoyable for certain audiences. The mention of continuity mistakes and subpar acting can sometimes add to the charm of a B-movie, and the reviewer's comparison to a home video of a camping trip could indicate a certain level of nostalgia or DIY appeal.

I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute they're supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",

  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While the movie may not adhere to traditional cinematic conventions like continuity editing and geographic match, its unconventional style could be seen as a deliberate artistic choice rather than a flaw.

  "review": "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Brad Sykes deserves credit for his dedication to creating low-budget horror films and for consistently trying to inject creativity and unique elements into his work. Despite the limitations, he manages to bring something interesting to the table and it's commendable that he keeps pushing forward despite the challenges.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. While it's admirable that Brad Sykes continues to produce films despite the challenges, the fact that his work receives less than enthusiastic receptions suggests that there may be fundamental issues with the quality or appeal of his movies. Relying on the audience to overlook shortcomings due to budget constraints can only go so far, and ultimately, a lack of resources should not be an excuse for subpar filmmaking."

  "review": "An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The performances were lackluster, the direction was uninspired, and the overall movie felt like a complete waste of time. The criticism of the amateurish performance and routine storytelling is spot on, and I also felt cheated by the lack of any redeeming qualities in the film.",

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",

I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",

  "review": "I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three 'Love' movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way too many goofs, and the editing was very poor - too many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way too soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have gone more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clark's character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review of Love's Abiding Joy. The movie did not live up to expectations and strayed too far from the original source material. The lack of emotional depth, poor editing, and disjointed scenes were major drawbacks. The early death of baby Kathy and the awkward inclusion of Clark's character were particularly disappointing. I also share the sentiment that the scriptwriters should have adhered more closely to Janette Oke's writings to maintain the essence of the story. Hopefully, future installments will rectify these issues and stay truer to the source material.",

My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than 'Love's Abiding Joy.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. As a fan of the book series, I was highly disappointed with how far the movie strayed from the original story. The inaccuracies in character names, ages, and the overall storyline were very off-putting. It's a disservice to both the author and the fans to have a movie that deviates so much from the source material.

The actors may not have delivered the most emotional performances, but that doesn't necessarily detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. While I appreciate"},

This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",

I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation of Love Come Softly. It's always frustrating when a beloved book is not faithfully translated to the screen, and it sounds like this film missed the mark in capturing the essence of the original story.

The hardships and challenges faced by the characters added depth and authenticity to the story, showcasing the harsh realities of that era.

  "review": "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that 'Love's Abiding Joy' is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'Love's Abiding Joy' falls short in terms of plot, acting, and editing. The movie does not live up to the potential of exploring Christian themes in a more engaging and thought-provoking manner. It's important for filmmakers in this genre to strive for higher quality to attract a wider audience and make a lasting impact.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of 'Love's Abiding Joy'. While the movie may have its flaws, it still serves as a representation of Christian values and storytelling.

Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The plot of the movie was indeed lacking and the focus on the light knife as the main attraction was disappointing. The cast may have been solid, but they were let down by the weak script and chaotic storyline. The movie failed to deliver on the potential of its premise and left much to be desired in terms of character development and engaging plot points.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the concept of the light knife and alien encounters to be intriguing. The use of these elements added a unique and imaginative touch to the film. Additionally, the solid cast brought depth to their characters, even if the plot may have been a bit convoluted at times. Overall, I believe the movie offered a different and entertaining take on the sci-fi thriller genre."

  "review": "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get 'terrorized' by this pathetic 'crazed killer', but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie's plot was indeed implausible, and the characters' actions were unrealistic and frustrating. The lack of logic and common sense displayed by the characters made it difficult to connect with the story or feel any sense of suspense or tension. The overall execution of the film fell flat, and I also found it to be a waste of time.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been perfect, I found some aspects of it to be engaging. The tension created by the 'crazed killer' and the characters' reactions added a sense of suspense to the story. The setting of the campsite and the wilderness added to the atmosphere of the film. While there were certainly flaws in the plot and character decisions, I still found some entertainment value in the movie."

The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie was indeed a disappointment. The plot was weak, the acting was subpar, and the story felt recycled. It's frustrating when you have high expectations based on the previews, only to be let down by the actual film. I also felt like it was a waste of time and would not recommend it to others.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may not have been groundbreaking, I found it to be an enjoyable watch.

I wouldn't say it was a waste of time, as I was entertained throughout."

And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
  "agree": "I completely understand where you're coming from. The plot of the movie did seem far-fetched and the concept of the mother getting visions through touch could be seen as unrealistic. Deedee Pfieffer's performance may not have been up to par, and I can see how that could be off-putting for viewers.",

  "review": "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
  "agree": "I agree that the episode seemed to prioritize style over content. The decision to shift the setting from the 1950s to the 1930s for aesthetic reasons may have detracted from the overall storytelling. Additionally, the plot points involving the Jarrow March and Japp's catering felt weak and could have been better developed to enhance the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that the episode was solely a victim of style over content. While the shift in time period may have been jarring for some viewers, it could also be seen as a creative choice to appeal to a wider audience. The exploration of themes such as social awareness among students and the struggles of the Jarrow Marchers could still hold relevance regardless of the time setting. Furthermore, the inclusion of details like Japp having to cater for himself added a touch of realism to the story."

  "review": "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read 'Our Sunshine'. There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal... Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent 'Secret History of the Kelly Gang'. 4/10",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the plot of the film was lacking despite the strong performances by the cast. It's disappointing when a movie with such potential falls short in delivering a compelling narrative.",

  "review": "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner. I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself 'this is the best I could have done with the material'. Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. Such is life.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie lacked depth, the script was unimpressive, and the pacing was off-kilter. The portrayal of Ned Kelly, a fascinating figure in Australian history, fell short of capturing the complexity and intrigue surrounding him. It's disappointing when a film with such potential fails to deliver on multiple levels.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may not have met the reviewer's expectations in terms of depth and storytelling, it's important to appreciate the effort that went into bringing Ned Kelly's story to the big screen. The actors' performances, though limited by the script, still managed to convey the essence of the characters. Additionally, the portrayal of Ned Kelly as a multifaceted figure, encompassing elements of folk genius, class warrior, and psychopath, adds layers to the narrative that shouldn't be overlooked."

  "review": "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel 'The True History of the Kelly Gang' I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie failed to do justice to the historical figure of Ned Kelly and instead opted for a more fantastical and romanticized approach. The comparison to Mick Jagger's portrayal being closer to reality is telling of the film's shortcomings in accurately depicting the story. The disappointment of expecting a more serious and authentic retelling of the Kelly Gang's history is palpable in this review.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have taken creative liberties in its portrayal of Ned Kelly, it still provided an entertaining and engaging cinematic experience. The blend of fantasy elements with historical events can be seen as a refreshing take on the story, offering a different perspective for viewers. Additionally, the cinematography capturing the Australian bush deserves recognition, adding to the overall visual appeal of the film."

I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was. I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",

  "review": "Perhaps because we've encountered this 'gentleman bandit' scenario so many times in the past, 'Ned Kelly' feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another. Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that 'Ned Kelly' falls into the trap of relying on familiar stereotypes and clichés of the 'gentleman bandit' genre. The portrayal of Ned Kelly as a heart-of-gold outlaw who only kills when necessary and is adored by the common folk feels repetitive and lacks originality. The inclusion of scenes like returning a stolen watch during a robbery and the romanticized criminal lifestyle further contribute to the film's lack of depth and innovation. Heath Ledger's performance in the title role also fails to bring substance to the character, and the forced voice-over narration adds to the film's pretentiousness.",

  "review": "This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie's lack of coherent narrative, underdeveloped characters, and poor production quality made it a struggle to watch. While the performances may have been decent, they were overshadowed by the subpar writing and direction. The film failed to do justice to the intriguing true story it was based on, and the importance of the subject matter does not excuse its overall lack of quality.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the performances of Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom to be captivating and engaging. The historical significance of the Ned Kelly story added depth to the film, and I appreciated the attempt to bring this important Australian icon to the screen. While it may not have been a perfect movie, I believe it had redeeming qualities that should not be overlooked."

Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.",

Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical. The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap. I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.",

  "review": "From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society. The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue. This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The heavy-handed political theme and lack of character development made the film predictable and unengaging.

The lack of depth in Ned Kelly's character and the overall storytelling made it difficult to connect with the film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the political theme may have been heavy-handed, it added a layer of relevance to the story. The portrayal of the police as antagonists could be seen as a deliberate choice to challenge traditional narratives.

The serious expression and direction style may have been a creative choice to convey the gravity of the story."

  "review": "I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!",

What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.",

The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.",

  "review": "There's not a drop of sunshine in \"The Sunshine Boys\", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****",

  "review": "I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose. Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially! In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Protocol had some scenes that dragged on too long and didn't add much to the overall story. The preachy scene at the end also felt out of place and detracted from the enjoyment of the film. While I appreciate having another Goldie Hawn movie in my collection, I can understand feeling like it may not have been worth the money spent on it.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review's assessment of Protocol. While I can see how some scenes may have felt unnecessary or dragged on, I believe that Goldie Hawn's performance and comedic timing still make the film enjoyable. The preachy scene at the end may not have been everyone's cup of tea, but I think it added a layer of depth to the story. Overall, I found Protocol to be a fun and entertaining watch, and I believe it was worth the purchase for fans of Goldie Hawn."

  "review": "Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. While Goldie Hawn is a talented actress, her charm alone cannot salvage a poorly executed plot. The implausibility of the story and the lackluster second half make it hard to recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a die-hard fan of hers.",

  "review": "There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and 'The Man who Fell to Earth.' I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the 'hillarious' gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Protocol was a disaster in terms of script, acting, and overall execution. The attempt at humor fell flat, and the offensive stereotypes were cringe-worthy. Goldie Hawn's performance was lackluster, and the whole film felt like a lazy attempt at filmmaking. It's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen.",
  "disagree": "I have to respectfully disagree with the review. While Protocol may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I found some elements of the film to be entertaining. Goldie Hawn's charm and comedic timing added a light-hearted touch to the story, and the film did have some moments of humor that resonated with me. While it may not be a standout film, I wouldn't classify it as the worst movie ever made."

Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.",
  "agree": "I agree that Goldie Hawn's scene in the movie was memorable and showcased her beauty and charisma from the '80s era. It's understandable how such a moment could leave a lasting impression on viewers, especially during their formative years.",

  "review": "I was excited to view a Cataluña´s film in the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the film. The excessive focus on blood, time, and various themes without a clear direction can indeed detract from the overall viewing experience. The portrayal of the Spanish Civil War and other sensitive topics may have been mishandled, leading to a lackluster and pseudo-tragic narrative. It's unfortunate to see talented actors like Angela Molina wasted in such a production. Your cautionary advice to avoid this film is well-founded.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your perspective on the film, I found it to be a bold and thought-provoking exploration of complex themes. The depiction of the Spanish Civil War, revenge, and societal attitudes towards homosexuality and Catholicism may have been intense, but they served to highlight the harsh realities of that era. Mr. Villaronga's approach, though unconventional, offered a unique perspective on these historical and human elements. Angela Molina's performance added depth to the narrative, showcasing her versatility as an actress. I would encourage viewers to see the film and form their own opinions."

  "review": "This film was a major letdown. The level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. Some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. The main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. The lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. The sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. Little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. Fortunately, I've been to Spain and realize this is not realistic! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid 'horror' was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. The actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed, this film might especially appeal to you.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The excessive violence and cruelty in the film were indeed disturbing, and the characters were unrelatable. The handling of same-sex attraction as a horror element was offensive, and the lack of depth in portraying the Spanish civil war was disappointing. The actors' discomfort in their roles was evident, and the overall atmosphere of the film felt over-the-top and unrealistic.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have been intense and unsettling, it could be argued that the portrayal of cruelty and violence served a purpose in highlighting the harsh realities of war. The characters' complexity, including the lead protagonist's slimy nature, could be seen as a deliberate choice to challenge traditional hero archetypes. The use of same-sex attraction as a theme, though controversial, could be interpreted as a commentary on societal taboos. Additionally, the discomfort displayed by the actors may have been a deliberate acting choice to convey the unsettling nature of the story."

  "review": "Three part horror film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go 'out there' and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why. The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable. The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though. The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary. It ends very stupidly. All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the first story in the film is worth watching. It was quick, violent, well-acted, and enjoyable despite being predictable. The acting was commendable, and it delivered on the horror elements effectively. The reviewer's assessment of the other two stories being lacking in suspense and scare factor resonates with my viewing experience.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment that the second story in the film was badly done and extremely slow. While it may have been obvious, the good acting mentioned could have potentially elevated the viewing experience. Additionally, the reviewer's criticism of the third story as not even remotely scary may overlook the film's attempt to explore different sub-genres within horror, such as psychological horror or suspense. The beautiful set designs and erotic feel could have added depth to the narrative beyond traditional scares."

The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.",

The editing style and camera angles did not add any value and only made it harder to stay engaged.

Despite its flaws, I believe there are some aspects of the movie that are worth appreciating."

  "review": "There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset. But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost. I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in 'A Time to kill' , and the 'The Newton Boys ' so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work. However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view. The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com. So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, 'A Time to kill' , 'The Newton Boys ' 'Frailty', 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days', 'Edtv' and 'Amistad' and avoid too 'Larger Than Life' and 'Angels in the Outfield' unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines. As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.",
  "agree": "I agree that the cinematography in the film is stunning and one of its best assets. The landscapes captured with beautiful light truly enhance the visual experience of the movie.",

  "review": "I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year. It is a very low budget movie. The story is set around Amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle where Laura is guarded by a ridiculous native who calls himself 'The Devil.' She has to go through all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that this film is rare to find and has a low budget. The setting in the Amazon jungle and the theme of fear of the devil add an intriguing element to the story. The portrayal of the native as 'The Devil' and the rescue mission by Peter Weston create a sense of suspense and adventure.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review as the depiction of violence and exploitation of women in the film is disturbing and unacceptable. The use of such graphic and offensive scenes detracts from any potential entertainment value the movie may have had. The portrayal of indigenous tribes in a negative light perpetuates harmful stereotypes and should not be glorified in any way."

The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp. To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short. 2 out of 10, kids.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. \"Devil Hunter\" was indeed a bizarre horror movie that failed to deliver on the elements that make such films enjoyable. The lack of scares, minimal gore, and unnecessary focus on certain aspects detracted from the overall viewing experience. The disjointed plot and questionable casting choices only added to the disappointment.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While \"Devil Hunter\" may not have been a masterpiece, its eccentricities and unconventional approach to the horror genre could be seen as a refreshing change from more formulaic films. The diverse casting and unique setting may have been intentional choices by the director to create a different kind of viewing experience. Additionally, the film's departure from traditional horror tropes could be viewed as a bold artistic statement rather than a failure."

  "review": "This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts. It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene. Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly. The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, 'They tore her heart out,' which is hilarious if you see the film.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film seems to have a disjointed focus, with unnecessary scenes that detract from the main storyline. The reviewer's point about the opening sequence and the bathtub scene resonates with me, as a more coherent narrative could have enhanced the viewing experience.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's negative tone towards the film's graphic content and shock value. While the reviewer may find certain elements distasteful, it's important to acknowledge that such extreme themes are often characteristic of the horror genre and can be appreciated by fans for their boldness and boundary-pushing nature."

  "review": "Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity. Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices). Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god. Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film sounds like a tedious and poorly executed mess, with little to redeem it other than gratuitous elements like gore, nudity, and a rape scene. Jess Franco's trademark style seems to have only added to the overall disappointment, making it a challenging watch that lacks substance or quality.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have its flaws and may not be a masterpiece, it seems to offer a certain level of entertainment value with its mix of jungle adventure, suspense, and elements of horror.

  "review": "How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? When you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all. Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. One of the 'freakiest' moments in the film is when 'Pablito' find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and 'Pablito' kicks it a bit for what I assume is 'shits n' giggles' and the eyes actually move... But, of course, then the 'freak' is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad... I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.",

While it's true that some horror movies can be so bad they're good, in this case, it seems like the film's shortcomings detract from any potential enjoyment.

The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.",

The pacing of the film was indeed slow due to excessive footage of people walking through the jungle, which made it feel longer than its actual runtime.

While there may have been scenes of people walking through the jungle to fill time, the overall pacing and runtime did not feel excessively long to me.

If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the addition of Venus as a female turtle was a departure from the original TMNT concept and took away from the unique dynamic of the four male turtles. The crossover with Power Rangers felt forced and the characters did not stay true to their established personalities. The design choices and animatronics could have been better executed, and the overall execution of the show was disappointing.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the show's visuals and character designs. While the addition of Venus may have deviated from the traditional TMNT storyline, it could have provided an interesting new perspective. The crossover with Power Rangers could have been a fun and exciting concept if executed well. The show's unique style and creative choices may not have appealed to everyone, but they added a fresh take on the classic TMNT universe."

  "review": "I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part. I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one which contains Venus. As a female turtle, she will not add any action to the story. We like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action. We wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer that introducing a female turtle, Venus, into the TMNT series deviates from the original concept of the four brothers named after great artists. The addition of Venus does not seem to add significant value or enhance the action in the story. The original TMNT series with the four brothers and their teacher Splinter was a classic that resonated with fans, and the introduction of a new character like Venus may not be well-received by those who appreciate the traditional dynamics of the group.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the reviewer's stance on the introduction of Venus as a female turtle in the TMNT series. While the original concept of the four brothers named after artists is iconic, introducing a female character like Venus can bring diversity and new perspectives to the story. Adding a female turtle could provide an opportunity to explore different dynamics within the group and offer fresh storytelling possibilities. It's important for franchises to evolve and introduce new elements to keep the narrative engaging and relevant for audiences."

  "review": "This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie). The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!! The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie. Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The acting in the film was indeed amateurish, and even Michael Madsen's performance was disappointing. The plot was lackluster and unoriginal, making it a struggle to sit through the entire movie. I would also advise against watching it and suggest finding a more enjoyable way to spend your time.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may not have been a cinematic masterpiece, I believe that there were some redeeming qualities to it. The acting, though not stellar, served its purpose in conveying the story. Additionally, the plot, while not groundbreaking, still managed to entertain and engage the audience. I think it's worth giving the movie a chance and forming your own opinion rather than dismissing it entirely based on this review."

Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage. OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.",

The acting was subpar, the writing was weak, and the inclusion of a gratuitous and unnecessary rape scene was appalling. It's disappointing when a film fails on so many levels, and I appreciate the reviewer's honesty in warning others to avoid it.",

  "review": "Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately. I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER. 3/10",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The flaws mentioned, such as the early goof and the sub-par acting, are indicative of a poorly executed film. The mention of a disturbing rape scene handled insensitively is also a major red flag. It's clear that this movie falls short in multiple aspects and is not worth the time or money to watch.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the criticisms raised in the review, I have to respectfully disagree with the overall assessment. Every movie has its flaws, and while the early goof and questionable acting are concerning, they may not necessarily ruin the entire viewing experience. Additionally, while the handling of the rape scene is crucial, it's possible that the reviewer's interpretation may differ from others'. It's important to consider different perspectives before completely dismissing a film."

  "review": "Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained? Of course, it is still a Hollywood mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The portrayal of guns as the central focus in movies has become a tired and overused trope in Hollywood. The lack of originality and reliance on clichés in this film only serves to further diminish the quality of storytelling in cinema. It's disheartening to see such uninspired content being produced and presented to audiences.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the frustration with the overuse of clichés and reliance on guns as a plot device in movies, I believe that there are still ways for films to explore these themes in a fresh and engaging manner. Not all movies that feature guns as a central element are inherently bad; it ultimately comes down to the execution and creativity of the filmmakers. While this particular film may have failed to deliver on those fronts, I don't think it's fair to categorically dismiss all movies that involve guns in their narratives."

Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks. The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better. The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have. Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night. vote: 1/10 (my first one)",

Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film. Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play. I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.",

Sometimes, low-budget or lesser-known films can offer unique perspectives or storytelling that may not appeal to everyone but could still have value.

  "review": "I saw this DVD in my friend's house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I thought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer. By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have difficulty in adjusting your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody is so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies out there that don't give even that effect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..",

The points raised about the budget constraints and the potential impact on the overall production quality are valid. It's commendable that the reviewer found value in the film's ability to provoke thought and reflection, even if the execution may have fallen short in certain aspects.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the reviewer's assessment that the movie was not as bad as others make it out to be.

  "review": "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional. Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like 'Lets get the F#$k out of here' and 'What are we going to do man'. He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back...",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The film did not provide a platform for the actors to showcase their skills, and the script was lacking depth and complexity. Michael Madsen's performance was hindered by the limitations of the script and direction, making it difficult for him to elevate his character beyond a two-dimensional portrayal. The sound effects and certain character portrayals also fell short, detracting from the overall viewing experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may have had its flaws in terms of script and character development, I found the presence of Turkish actors to bring a unique cultural element to the story. Additionally, I appreciated Michael Madsen's attempt to embody a tough character, even if the script did not fully support his performance. The sound effects, although criticized, may have added a different stylistic touch to the gunfight scenes. Overall, while the film may not have been perfect, I believe there were some redeeming qualities worth acknowledging."

I've watched it at least 20 times.... the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines. on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was. i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.",

  "review": "I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy. Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos. I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film. I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film. All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.",

While Arnold Vosloo's performance may have been a standout, it's important to acknowledge the impact of the supporting cast and direction on the overall quality of the movie. The issues with continuity, sound effects, and the portrayal of certain scenes cannot be solely attributed to Vosloo's presence. These aspects play a crucial role in shaping the viewer's experience and should not be overlooked."

  "review": "This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s. The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and 'with it' to be understood by us mortals.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's experimental nature and lack of plot or dialogue may appeal to a niche audience, but for the average viewer, it can quickly become tedious and unengaging. The dated camera tricks and pop art stylings may be interesting from a historical perspective, but they do little to elevate the overall viewing experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may not be everyone's cup of tea, its avant-garde approach and lack of traditional narrative can be seen as a bold artistic statement.

Because of the style this film has been filmed, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards).

Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does. So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it. 1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie fails to deliver a convincing storyline and believable character relationships in the Gangster/Drug scene genre. The motives of the characters feel cliché and far-fetched, and the film lacks depth in exploring the dynamics between the characters. The focus on 'cool' production techniques and special effects detracts from allowing the story to naturally evolve and the characters to reflect. It falls short of being a solid socially critical drama and instead veers towards being a cheap action movie with average performances.",

  "review": "From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the director seemed to prioritize style over substance in this movie, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying viewing experience. The attempt to create a stylish film at the expense of a coherent story is evident and ultimately unsuccessful. While the director may have a good understanding of the technical aspects of filmmaking, the overall execution falls short.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment that the movie is a total waste of time and effort. While the director may have prioritized style over substance, the film still manages to maintain continuity and features decent performances from the actors. Despite its flaws, there are redeeming qualities in the movie that prevent it from being categorized as one of the worst films ever made."

The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot. However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time? The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache. All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless you're a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie was boring and over-dramatic. The excessive cussing and flashy camera work can be off-putting and distracting. While the plot may have had some redeeming qualities, the overall experience was lacking and not worth the time unless you are a die-hard fan of a specific cast member.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's focus on CHACE CRAWFORD as the main reason for watching the movie. While his presence may have been a draw for some viewers, it should not overshadow the overall quality of the film. The reviewer's emphasis on the cast's physical appearance detracts from a more critical analysis of the movie's storytelling and filmmaking techniques."

Having read the novel 'Union Street' before watching the film, I also found the adaptation lacking in capturing the raw and gritty essence of the original work. While the film was well-made and had positive elements, it failed to truly convey the darkness and harsh realities depicted in the book.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the disappointment in the film not fully capturing the essence of the novel 'Union Street', I believe that adaptations often have to make creative choices to fit the medium of film.

  "review": "I saw the capsule comment said 'great acting.' In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true 'bummer.' I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The performances by the lead actors were indeed lackluster and lacked chemistry. The pacing of the film was excruciatingly slow, making it difficult to stay engaged. The characters seemed poorly written, and the overall execution of the film fell short of expectations. I also found it to be a disappointing effort from a usually great director.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the performances may not have been the best from these talented actors, I believe they still brought depth to their characters. The film's message about illiteracy and the journey to overcome it can be seen as uplifting and important. Additionally, the director's vision, even if not executed perfectly, still had merit. Overall, I found some redeeming qualities in the film despite its flaws."

The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what? Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.",

The script and dialogues were poorly executed, and Jane Fonda's character felt like a caricature.

Swoozie Kurtz's performance may have been a highlight, but it couldn't salvage the film's shortcomings. This movie is definitely one to avoid.",

While I acknowledge the criticisms regarding the portrayal of the characters and the pacing of the movie, I believe that the talented cast, including Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda, brought depth to their roles.

A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",

  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. The lack of creativity, unmanaged actors, and overall disappointment in Bait make it a difficult film to watch. The criticism of Jamie Foxx's performance and the lack of emotional depth in the movie are valid points that I also found to be major drawbacks.",

You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the 'bad guy' looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.",

As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.",

  "review": "I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat. I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley. The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime. I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the 'reformed' Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal. I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...",
  "agree": "I completely understand your disappointment with the movie adaptation. It's always frustrating when a beloved book is not faithfully translated to the screen. The deviations from the original story and the lackluster performances can really detract from the viewing experience. I agree that George C. Scott's portrayal seemed inconsistent, and the overall quality of the production may not have lived up to expectations. It's a shame that such a poignant moment like the whirlwind tour was omitted, as it holds significant emotional weight in the narrative. Your points about the portrayal of Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim are valid, as they are crucial characters in the story. It's disappointing when key elements are not given the attention they deserve in a film adaptation.",

His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Scott's performance was indeed lackluster and failed to convey the emotional depth required for the role of Scrooge.

Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" Other times I almost fell asleep. The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all. I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny.",

You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New England and who are reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. 'OK now stand up.' As for the other characters, there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in 'Journey to the Beginning of Time' (1955). The special effects are imaginative. The music is good. Bottom line, this film makes 'Equinox' or 'Planet of the Dinosaurs' look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know 'Mysterious Planet' was a home movie and was on a shoestring budget? A must-watch for aspiring filmmakers.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The flaws in sound editing, amateurish acting, and visible directorial presence all detract from the overall viewing experience. While the special effects may be imaginative, the jerky animation and overall low-budget feel make it hard to fully appreciate the film's potential. This movie may have some charm for those familiar with the New England setting, but for most viewers, it falls short of expectations.",

While the film may have its flaws, such as sound editing issues and amateurish acting, it also offers a unique and imaginative take on the source material. The presence of the director's voice and the unconventional character traits add a layer of authenticity and creativity to the storytelling.

The opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life. And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius. The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.",

The description of the poor special effects and awful sound track in the first 15 minutes sounds like a trainwreck that could be entertaining in its own right.

While the description of the movie's flaws may make it sound comically bad, I find it hard to believe that such poor quality would be enjoyable to watch. The idea of enduring such terrible special effects and sound for even 15 minutes does not sound appealing to me.

The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK. I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a 'D'.",

The use of a former star like Peter Falk was a nice touch, but the overall delivery and predictability of the plot made it fall short of being engaging.

While the story may have been predictable and the overall movie sub-par, it's unfair to solely criticize Russ's acting abilities.

Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best. Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like 'Miracle on 34th Street', Ernst Lubitsch's delightful 'The shop around the corner' and, of course the 1951 version of 'Scrooge'. There's Frank Capra's classics 'It's a wonderful life' and 'Meet John Doe'. Hey, forget the classics.

The performances, sets, costumes, and storyline all fell short, making it a difficult movie to sit through. Sooraj Badjatya's attempt to recreate the success of his previous films like Hum Aapke Hain Kaun fell flat, and the movie failed to deliver any redeeming qualities.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While Vivah may not have been a groundbreaking film, it did have its moments of charm and sweetness. The performances, especially by Alok Nath and Amrita Rao, added a certain warmth to the movie. The film's focus on family values and traditions resonated with some audiences, making it a decent watch for those who appreciate a more traditional and melodramatic style of storytelling."

  "review": "I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that this movie fell short of expectations and was old-fashioned. The lack of twists and the predictable storyline were disappointing. The characters' behavior, such as the excessive shyness and constant need for permission, felt unrealistic. The portrayal of the aunt as merely a complainer rather than a more complex character was a missed opportunity. The reviewer's comparison to Hum Aapke Hain Kaun highlights the shortcomings of this film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's overall negative assessment of the movie. While it may not have met the reviewer's expectations, it still had some redeeming qualities. The depiction of a happy family dynamic, albeit idealized, can be comforting and enjoyable for some viewers. The presence of familiar actors like Mohnish Behl can add a sense of nostalgia for fans. Additionally, the emotional moments in the film, such as the protagonist winning her aunt's love, can resonate with audiences looking for a heartwarming story."

  "review": "A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely you're movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people! Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something.. I just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The romance in the movie was indeed very unrealistic and overly perfect. While Shahid Kapoor's performance was commendable, the overall plot felt like a fairy tale designed for those who prefer dreamy, idealistic love stories. The criticism of the unrealistic scenes is valid, and I also believe that for viewers seeking a more grounded and relatable storyline, this movie may not be the best choice.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the romance may have been portrayed in a dreamy and idealistic manner, that is often the appeal of such films for many viewers. Not every movie needs to mirror reality, and the escapism provided by a Cinderella story can be enjoyable for those looking for a break from the real world. Additionally, the mention of Shahid Kapoor's performance as a standout factor suggests that there are elements of the movie worth appreciating beyond just the romantic plot. Ultimately, personal preferences play a significant role in how one perceives a film, and for fans of romantic fantasies, this movie could still be a worthwhile watch."

  "review": "After being hugely entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a cad in \"The Tailor of Panama\" (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional impact, etc.), I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that \"The Tailor of Panama\" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7? Hardly.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The disappointment felt after enjoying Brosnan's performance in \"The Tailor of Panama\" was palpable in this film. The lackluster script and direction made it feel like a mere script reading rather than a compelling movie. The excessive vulgarity seemed forced and devoid of substance, in stark contrast to the richness and satisfaction of the previous film. The anticipation for a standout moment was never fulfilled, leaving the viewer devoid of emotional engagement. The assessment of the film's value being far from worth the price is spot on.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the disappointment stemming from high expectations after enjoying Brosnan's performance in \"The Tailor of Panama,\" I found this film to offer a different experience. The raw and unapologetic portrayal, though vulgar at times, added a layer of authenticity and grit to the story. The script reading style may have been intentional to focus on the characters and their interactions, providing a unique perspective. The absence of traditional emotional cues like laughter or tears could be seen as a deliberate choice to challenge conventional storytelling. Despite its flaws, I believe the film had its own merits and offered a thought-provoking experience."

  "review": "The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the 'He Woman, Man Hater' clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be 'caught up' in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie fails to provide a balanced perspective and leaves many questions unanswered. The portrayal of the characters and the storyline seem one-sided, which can be frustrating for viewers looking for a more nuanced exploration of the events. The focus on the secretary's relationship with a married man without delving into other aspects of the story limits the depth of the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the movie caters to 'He Woman, Man Hater' clubs. While the film may have its flaws in terms of storytelling and character development, it is unfair to dismiss it as appealing only to a specific group. The critique of the secretary's actions and the lack of exploration of other perspectives may be valid, but it does not necessarily mean that the movie is targeted at a particular audience."

  "review": "This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office. But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise. Andie MacDowell gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the writer-director. If Notting Hill annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film does feel like a cheap attempt to replicate the success of other popular movies, and the characters come across as unrealistic and unrelatable. The plot seems to rely on contrived and nonsensical actions, making it hard to invest in the story. Andie MacDowell's efforts are commendable, but Imelda Staunton truly shines in her role. Overall, the film falls flat in its execution and fails to deliver a genuine and engaging experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have drawn inspiration from other successful movies, it's unfair to dismiss it as a mere cash grab. The characters, though perhaps exaggerated, bring a certain charm and wit to the screen. The plot, though unconventional, keeps the audience engaged with its unexpected twists and turns. Andie MacDowell and Imelda Staunton both deliver strong performances that add depth to the story. Despite its flaws, the film offers a unique and entertaining take on romantic comedy that may appeal to a different audience."

Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The scenes mentioned felt overly dramatic and unrealistic, and Andie's acting did not seem convincing. The other actresses in the film definitely outshined her, and the overall campy feel of the movie was off-putting. The criticism of Andie's appearance and makeup also resonates with my viewing experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While some scenes may have felt exaggerated, I found the Hollywood elements to be part of the film's charm. Andie's acting, though criticized, may have been intentional to fit the tone of the movie. Additionally, the chemistry between the characters, including Kate and Jed, felt genuine to me. The critique on Andie's appearance seems irrelevant to the film's quality and storytelling."

Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.",

  "disagree": "I disagree with the review.

  "review": "This was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film that portrays England as full of Chocolate box cottages, and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour. A final note- what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. Andie Macdowell's performance was indeed lacking, and the film's inconsistent tone made it difficult to fully engage with the story. The mix of comedy and serious themes felt disjointed, and the implausibility of certain character interactions detracted from the overall viewing experience. The presence of talented actresses like Staunton and Chancellor only highlighted the shortcomings of the film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While Andie Macdowell's performance may not have been the strongest, I believe that the film's blend of comedy and serious themes added depth to the story. The contrast between the lighter moments and the more tragic elements could be seen as a reflection of the complexities of women's friendships. Additionally, the unique setting and visual style of the film, while somewhat stereotypical, added to its charm and whimsy."

Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's SO devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the 'good news'! By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better! As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! It's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Where's the guilt over poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this 'movie'!",

  "review": "I thought it was a New-York located movie: wrong! It's a little British countryside setting. I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally 'abracadabrantesque', the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling. What Do I have left? Maybe, a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. The tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and McDowell delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. In her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works. Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. The women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people. Finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie offers a unique perspective on women's lives and relationships, showcasing different points of view and bringing a sense of tolerance and learning. The portrayal of the characters and their individual ways of living adds depth to the story and makes it engaging for viewers.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's criticism of the movie becoming 'abracadabrantesque' towards the end. While the shift in tone may have been unexpected, it could be seen as a creative choice to add depth and complexity to the storyline. The movie's ability to surprise and challenge the audience's expectations can be a positive aspect, rather than a negative one."

  "review": "Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's tonal shifts were confusing and made it hard to connect with the characters. The attempt to blend comedy with serious drama fell flat, resulting in an unconvincing and unsatisfying finale. It's clear that the filmmakers struggled to find a cohesive direction for the story, leading to a disappointing viewing experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the film may have had tonal inconsistencies, I believe that the blend of light-hearted banter and darker themes could have been intentional to create a complex narrative. The evolution of the characters and their relationships could have been meant to challenge traditional storytelling conventions. While the finale may not have been perfect, I appreciate the attempt to explore different emotional layers within the story."

  "review": "Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequent falling-out with 2 long-time best girlfriends. Seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man, the 'girl-friends', dead-set on terminating this 'silly relationship', go over and beyond the call of duty in 'helping out' their friend (who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game). A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous. Far-fetched no longer covers it. Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. Instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. There is much better material out there. This one isn't worth your time.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The plot seems far-fetched and the situations portrayed are just too ridiculous to be believable. The characters' actions and decisions are hard to relate to, and it ultimately detracts from what could have been a sweet love story. I also found myself shaking my head at the unbelievable events that unfolded. This movie definitely fell short of expectations and I would not recommend it to others.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the criticism of the unrealistic situations in the film, I believe that Andie McDowell's performance as the lead character was captivating and brought depth to the story. The dynamics between the characters, though exaggerated at times, added an interesting layer to the narrative.

No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come. But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it. I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it. The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.",

I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it.",

While the film may not have resonated with everyone, it's important to acknowledge that humor and storytelling preferences vary among audiences.

It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a 'chick flick', and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent 'plot' (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE. Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.",
  "agree": "I completely understand your perspective on this film. It's disappointing when movies resort to tired stereotypes and fail to provide meaningful character development. The lack of realism and believability can definitely detract from the overall viewing experience. It's frustrating when a film aimed at a specific demographic ends up being more demeaning than empowering.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I found this film to be a refreshing take on relationships and self-discovery. The exploration of unconventional themes and character choices can be seen as a bold move rather than a failure. Andy McDowell's performance, though subjective, may have resonated with some viewers. Sometimes, films that challenge traditional narratives can spark important conversations and offer a different perspective on storytelling."

  "review": "I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man. Intriguing. NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down. Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town. And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette! Right. Like I said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had a promising premise but failed to deliver on its potential. The characters were poorly developed and the script did not do justice to the talented actresses involved. The portrayal of women in the film was disappointing, with unrealistic behaviors and lack of depth. The missed opportunities and lack of meaningful plot development left much to be desired. I would also rate it a 4 out of 10.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the premise to be engaging and the dynamic between the three women to be interesting. The performances by Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton were commendable, despite the limitations of the script. The blend of slapstick and screwball comedy added a unique touch to the film, and I appreciated the attempt to explore themes of friendship and love. While not perfect, I believe the movie deserves more credit than a 4 out of 10 rating."

  "review": "The Crush is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit 'Sex and the City'. I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out. They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of 'Sabrina' or with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials. Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex-pat are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina and that the writer/director being male may have influenced the storytelling. The idea of the film potentially exploring the lives of three gay men coming out in relation to their lovers and at work sounds like it could have added more depth and interest to the movie.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's suggestion that the movie would have been better as a story about three gay men. While that could have been an interesting concept, the film as it is, focusing on the dynamics between the characters in a romantic setting, has its own charm and appeal. The portrayal of relationships and age dynamics in The Crush is engaging in its own right."

It is quite predictable, not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous. You know the recipe. The other actors... well, I just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I must mention some of them are not even actors (e.g. Mihaela Radulescu). So to summarize it: 'girl band t.A.T.u.' + desperate/publicity needing 'actors' + a non-existing plot + the occasion to use bad language in order to shock = Love Sick. Too bad... the idea was good, though... and I am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...",

The predictability and lack of originality in the storyline are valid points. The resemblance to t.A.T.u. and the use of well-known personalities as actors without clear roles also detract from the overall impact of the film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that the movie had to rely on using something already famous like t.A.T.u. to support its lack of originality. While the film may have missed the mark in exploring deeper themes, the use of familiar faces from Romania's entertainment scene could have added a unique element to the storytelling.

The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the 'sex scenes' is absolutely absent. The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children, yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie. It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap. All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it. I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does. And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie's reliance on controversial themes without substance, poor dialogue, lack of sensuality in the 'sex scenes,' and inadequate acting make it a disappointing and shallow experience. The excessive use of inner monologues further detracts from the overall quality of the film. It's a missed opportunity for Romanian cinema and fails to engage mature audiences effectively.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the movie may have its flaws in terms of dialogue and execution, the exploration of controversial themes like incest and lesbianism can be a bold and thought-provoking choice in storytelling. The use of inner monologues, though excessive, could add depth to the characters and their motivations. Additionally, the casting of musicians like Tudor Chirila can bring a fresh perspective to acting and contribute to the diversity of performances on screen."

  "review": "I am not so much like Love Sick as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future. Ending up was sad. The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday 12:00PM on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate. On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story. The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting for…. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The 'ear piercing' part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love. Also, the scene of they were lying in the soccer field, the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film lacked depth in portraying how the characters fell in love and the absence of a scene depicting Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse was disappointing. The fragmented storytelling made it challenging to fully connect with the characters' emotions and motivations. The love triangle felt more like a cliché next-door neighborhood story rather than a complex exploration of relationships. The reviewer's points about the film's shortcomings are valid and reflect my own disappointment with the movie.",

  "review": "Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers 'sensually' caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said...but please watch the movie yourselves...I am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives...like I did :(",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie failed to live up to the expectations set by its marketing campaign and the initial premise. The lack of depth in exploring the themes of incest and lesbianism was disappointing, and the acting felt forced and artificial. It's a shame that such promising themes were not given the attention they deserved, making the overall viewing experience a letdown.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have delved deeply into the themes of incest and lesbianism, I believe that its subtlety added a layer of complexity to the storytelling. The opening scene, while provocative, set the tone for the complex relationship between the two brothers. The acting, though not perfect, had moments of authenticity that resonated with me. Overall, I found the movie to be a thought-provoking exploration of familial dynamics and sexuality."

  "review": "Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the movie had potential but fell short in execution. The storytelling seemed lacking, the visuals and sound needed improvement, and the acting did not fully engage the audience. The criticism of the film being like a picture for adults told by children resonates with me, as it suggests a disconnect in the maturity and depth of the narrative.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh assessment of the movie. While there may have been flaws in the execution, the unique storytelling approach and unconventional visuals could have been intentional artistic choices. The portrayal of the characters as poetical rather than strictly realistic could have added depth and complexity to the narrative. Additionally, the perspective of the landlady as the standout actress could be seen as a refreshing and unexpected aspect of the film."

    "review": "Closer to reality and containing more depth than 'Breakdance', Stan Lathan's 'Beat Street' is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer. Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day. Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift 'Beat Street' to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting. Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",
    "agree": "I agree with the review that 'Beat Street' falls short in generating audience interest and fails to fully engage with its characters. While the music and dancing are entertaining, they are not enough to compensate for the lackluster storytelling and character development. The film misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the lives of the young friends and their talents, leaving the audience wanting more substance and depth.",
    "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assessment that 'Beat Street' is a dull show. While it may not reach the heights of some other films in the genre, the movie still offers a glimpse into the lives of young individuals in Queens, New York, each with their own unique talents. The choreography and music add energy and vibrancy to the film, providing entertainment value. While the storytelling may have its flaws, the film still manages to capture the essence of the 'hip hop' culture of the time and offers a window into a specific community and its creative expressions."

  "review": "Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer that Beat Street may not capture the authentic grittiness of early Hip Hop culture and that it comes across as overproduced with a Hollywood touch. The comparison to Wild Style and Style Wars, which are seen as more authentic representations of Hip Hop, is valid. The focus on music and dancing in Beat Street seems to overshadow other aspects like story, acting, and dialogue.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the reviewer's harsh assessment of Beat Street as 'trash.' While it may not fully capture the rawness of early Hip Hop culture, the movie still serves as a platform for showcasing original artists and their talents. The music and dancing elements, which the reviewer acknowledges as enjoyable, are integral to the film's appeal and should not be discounted entirely. Additionally, personal preferences for beats and music styles should not overshadow the"},

  "review": "I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first 'grown-up' role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.",
  "agree": "I completely understand where you're coming from. The movie failed to capture my interest as well, and I found it lacking in many aspects. The portrayal of California teens and their parents felt shallow and unconvincing, making it hard to invest in the characters or the storyline. The performances, including Jodie Foster's, couldn't salvage the weak script and uninspired direction. It's disappointing to see such potential wasted on a film that ultimately falls flat.",
  "disagree": "While I respect your opinion, I have to disagree with your assessment of the movie. I found the skateboard chase scene with Scott Baio to be a fun and exciting moment that injected some much-needed energy into the film. Jodie Foster's performance, as always, was captivating and added depth to her character. The portrayal of California teens in the 1970s may have been bleak, but it felt authentic and provided a unique perspective on that era. The film's flaws aside, I believe there were redeeming qualities that made it worth watching."

  "review": "Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie failed to deliver on multiple fronts, from the acting to the plot. The attempt to incorporate the Ramones felt forced and did not add any value to the overall experience. I would also recommend watching Wild Zero for a more entertaining B movie experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may not have been a masterpiece, it still had its charm and entertainment value. The incorporation of the Ramones' music added a unique element to the film, and the theme of rebellion against oppressive authority resonated with many viewers. The movie may not be for everyone, but it certainly has its merits."

Unless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone appears to like them in this movie. There is not a plot to be found in this flick. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.",

  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. As a major Ramones fan, I found the concert sequences to be exhilarating and a highlight of the movie. While the plot may have been lacking, the energy and music of the Ramones made the film enjoyable for me. It's understandable that not everyone would appreciate this style of movie, but for fans of the band, it was a fun experience."

  "review": "I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the 'actor' was that played Jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film lacked quality in many aspects. The direction seemed amateurish and the overall execution was poor. While Dominic Monaghan's acting stood out, it was not enough to salvage the film. The criticism of the supporting cast and character development is valid, and I also believe that more effort should have been put into these areas. Overall, I share the sentiment that viewers may be disappointed by this film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's harsh criticism of the director and the suggestion that she should reconsider her career choice. While the film may have had its flaws, it is important to remember that filmmaking is a complex and challenging art form. Constructive feedback is valuable, but personal attacks on the director are unwarranted. Additionally, while the film may not have met the reviewer's expectations, it is subjective whether it is a complete waste of time and money for all viewers. Different people have different tastes, and some may still find value in the film despite its shortcomings."

It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show's highlights.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The episode felt like a rehash of overused themes and lacked any originality. The plot was predictable and failed to bring anything new to the table. It definitely falls short of being a standout episode in the series.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the episode may have utilized familiar themes, I found the tension between the wife, the Santa killer, and the daughter to be gripping and well-executed. The performances, especially by Mary Ellen Trainor and Larry Drake, added depth to the characters and kept me engaged throughout. I believe this episode offered a thrilling and suspenseful take on a classic storyline."

The acting, though unconventional, felt raw and authentic, making the viewing experience engaging throughout."

  "review": "Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that Iberia may be better suited for TV viewing rather than the silver screen due to its focus on dance and music. The mention of Bollywood movies as a better option for showcasing breathtaking dancing in a longer format is valid, as they excel in combining entertainment with dance sequences.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's assertion that Iberia is not suitable for the silver screen. While the film may not be grandiose or larger than life, its focus on skillful dancing and the director's experience in capturing dance on film can still make it an engaging watch for those interested in classical music and modern dance."

  "review": "That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the 'This Network' airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.",

Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line. The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie had a weak script, poor direction, and a confusing ending. The performances, with the exception of Clancy Brown and Michael Pollard, were lackluster. The characters lacked depth and the plot was predictable. The actions of the female lead and her brother, the cop, felt illogical and the overall viewing experience was disappointing.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have had its flaws, I found the performances to be engaging, particularly from Clancy Brown and Michael Pollard. The relationship between the father and son, though not perfectly executed, still had moments of emotional resonance. The plot twists, while somewhat predictable, added tension to the story.

  "review": "Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior 'The Last Command' from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although Raul Julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's WAY too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours, like this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy. Skip it.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The criticisms about the film looking cheap, the disorganized action scenes, and the historical inaccuracies are all valid points. The comparison to 'The Last Command' and the suggestion to watch John Wayne's 1960 version instead make sense. The length of the movie being too long also adds to the overall negative viewing experience. It's disappointing that a director like Burt Kennedy delivered such a lackluster film.",
  "disagree": "While I understand some of the criticisms in the review, I have to disagree with the overall assessment. I found the film to have a certain charm in its attempt to depict the historical events, even if inaccuracies were present. The performances, especially by Raul Julia, added depth to the characters. Additionally, I appreciated the homage to 'The Last Command' and saw it as a creative choice rather than a flaw. The pacing, although slow, allowed for a more immersive experience in the story.

The story was terrible, inaccuracy all through it, and just downright untruths to boot! Continuity was cast to the four winds. Anybody catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes. Come on! Then there is Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer must of been away or something. Or just out of their mind!",

The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude. As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate. Very disappointing - avoid it.",

The poor production quality and the lack of believability in the actors' portrayals further detracted from the overall viewing experience. As a viewer who values historical accuracy, I found this movie to be a major disappointment and would recommend avoiding it.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While I understand the importance of historical accuracy, I believe that movies can also be appreciated for their entertainment value and artistic interpretation. The portrayal of the Alamo events through a mythological lens can offer a unique perspective and engage audiences in a different way.

He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.",

While it may have deviated from the original story in some aspects, the beauty of the fly casting scenes and the strong performances by actors like Tom Skerritt and Craig Sheffer should be acknowledged.

The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.",

While the cinematography and acting were impressive, the lack of a compelling story and the unrelatable characters made it a disappointing watch. The predictability of the ending also took away from any potential impact the film could have had.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review of 'A River Runs Through It'. While the story may not have been action-packed or filled with twists, the film beautifully captures the complexities of family dynamics and the struggles of finding one's place in the world. The slow pace and introspective nature of the narrative added to the overall atmosphere of the movie, making it a poignant and thought-provoking experience for those who appreciate character-driven stories."

  "review": "I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw 'The Fast And The Furious'. So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. A film without a plot can feel aimless and lacking in substance. It's disappointing when a movie drags on without a clear direction or conflict to engage the audience. While aesthetics like scenery and costumes can be visually pleasing, they can't make up for a weak storyline.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While having a strong plot is important for many films, there are instances where a more atmospheric or character-driven approach can be effective. Not every movie needs a traditional plot with clear conflict to be engaging or thought-provoking. The focus on scenery and costumes could have been a deliberate choice by the filmmakers to create a specific mood or aesthetic."

It spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it. The picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling. If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story. There isn't one.",

While the movie may have lacked a traditional plot structure, I found the focus on the Montana scenery and fly fishing to be a refreshing change from typical narratives.

  "review": "The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford never made that many with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Each of the five films of Mann have huge gaps, or is it six, lets see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene, with fairly glaring lapses. But The Far Country has huge, huge holes. It's mawkish, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locking horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. The Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man. But that was Mann's territory. What a great, great director. See every western he ever made. They are his real monuments, even if all are sketchy. But so what. When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody, including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone, period.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the review. Anthony makes a compelling argument about the brilliance of Anthony Mann's westerns and the uneven yet captivating nature of his films. The analysis of the performances by actors like James Stewart and the intense physicality captured by Mann's camera work is spot on. Despite the flaws and gaps in some of the films, the reviewer rightly praises Mann's directorial prowess and the impact of his westerns as a whole.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I acknowledge the strengths of Anthony Mann's westerns and the impact of his direction, I believe that the assertion that his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done is a bit overstated. While Mann's films have their moments of brilliance, there are other directors and westerns that also deserve recognition for their contributions to the genre. Additionally, the review's comparison to John Ford's work may not fully capture the nuances and impact of Ford's films in the western genre."},

  "review": "Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West. Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment of the historical inaccuracies in the film. It's disappointing when filmmakers take such liberties with historical events and locations, especially when it misrepresents a real place like Dawson City during the Klondike gold rush.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge the historical inaccuracies pointed out by the reviewer, I still found the film to be an enjoyable watch. The stunning cinematography of the Alberta Rocky Mountains and the performances by Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan were enough to keep me engaged despite the fictionalized elements of the plot."

  "review": "This action Western starring James Stewart and an all-star cast in the scenic Northwest is filmed in great splendor, with fantastic scenery and costumes. The film offers plenty of action and adventure as Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who clashes with a crooked government in the old Northwest.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the minor characters in the film are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others add depth and entertainment value to the movie, making it worth watching.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's criticism of the main character played by James Stewart. While the character may exhibit some cynical traits, his complexity and interactions with his partners add credibility and likability to his portrayal. The nuanced performance by Stewart elevates the character beyond being a one-dimensional hero."

  "review": "This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make sense. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever. Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime. Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sort of impact upon people.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The plot of the movie sounds nonsensical and the premise of the killer targeting people making a movie about the first movie is indeed quite ridiculous. It seems like a lazy attempt to capitalize on the success of the original without adding anything of substance. I would definitely avoid watching this film based on this review.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the premise may sound far-fetched, sometimes sequels take creative risks to differentiate themselves from the original. The blend of horror, action, and crime genres could potentially offer a unique viewing experience. It's important to keep an open mind and judge the movie for its entertainment value rather than dismissing it outright based on initial impressions."

I regret for watching it. The original 'Cabin By The Lake' was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word. The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction. My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making. You have been warned.",

While 'Return To Cabin By The Lake' may not have lived up to the original and may have its flaws, sometimes a cheesy horror movie can still be entertaining in its own way.

It's always worth giving a movie a chance and forming your own opinion, even if it's not a critical darling."

  "review": "Return to Cabin by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the 'home video' type effect! I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.",

It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a 'reason' to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to 'look real when they died'? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... I would watch a 'Cabin by the Lake 3'. Only because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal.",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer that the sequel had potential but fell short in terms of plot development and character motivations. The killings and attempted killings seemed to lack clear reasoning, and the focus on trying to make them 'look real' instead of utilizing special effects was a missed opportunity. Judd Nelson's performance was a standout, but overall, the film could have been better executed.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the reviewer's assessment that the sequel had potential. While the plot may have had some interesting elements, the lack of clear character motivations and the cheesy execution detracted from the overall viewing experience. Additionally, the reliance on clichés such as the captured girl escaping and the antagonist disappearing felt predictable and uninspired. Judd Nelson's performance may have been a highlight, but it wasn't enough to salvage the shortcomings of the film."

  "review": "I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",
  "agree": "I agree with the reviewer that the use of DV in the sequel was perplexing and seemed out of place. It detracted from the viewing experience and left me equally disappointed.

  "disagree": "While I understand the disappointment with the use of DV in the sequel and the open ending, I found the overall storyline and suspense in the movie to be engaging.

Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review. While the sequel had potential, it fell short of capturing the essence of the original. Judd Nelson's performance, though intense, bordered on being too exaggerated, and the humor in the film did not quite hit the mark. The overall execution of the movie felt rushed and lacking in depth.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review. Despite not reaching the same level as the original, the sequel still managed to deliver an entertaining and suspenseful storyline. Judd Nelson's portrayal of the murderous screenwriter added a chilling intensity to the film, and the tongue-in-cheek approach provided a unique twist. While some aspects may have been over the top, they contributed to the overall dark and twisted atmosphere of the movie."

  "review": "Return to Cabin by the Lake does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequel, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the storyline and acting were really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequels to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas; it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone; watching it will just detract from the first.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The lack of continuity with the original film and the poor acting in Return to Cabin by the Lake make it a disappointing sequel. It fails to capture the essence of the first movie and falls short in every aspect. I also found the acting to be subpar and not engaging, which significantly detracted from the viewing experience. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original, as it does not live up to its predecessor.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While Return to Cabin by the Lake may not reach the same level as the original, I believe it still has some merit as a standalone film. The return of the character Stanley provides a sense of continuity, and the storyline, although not as strong as the first movie, still offers some entertainment value. While the acting may not be top-notch, I don't think it's as terrible as described in the review. Overall, I think the movie can be enjoyed for what it is, even if it doesn't surpass the original."

I told him that I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. 'What was it supposed to be?' I asked. 'A propaganda movie made for children?' The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your DVD or Video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had made Razzies in the '40s, this would have won in every category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious sobriquet of 'Stairway to Heaven.')",

It's understandable why the reviewer found it to be one of the silliest movies ever made.

  "review": "Despite a decent first season, this series never came close to realizing its potential. Set as a prequel to the original 'Star Trek' series, it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a 'Star Trek' series could be. The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology. Never have I seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors last so long. Unfortunately, it appears as if Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing the higher-ups at Paramount that 'Enterprise' suffered from 'franchise fatigue' and that its core audience was driven off.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. 'Enterprise' had so much potential but was ultimately held back by the limitations imposed by the producers and showrunner. The lack of innovation and the repetitive nature of the episodes made it difficult for the show to stand out in a landscape where viewers were demanding more sophisticated and engaging content.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the notion that 'Enterprise' was a complete failure. While it may not have lived up to the high standards set by its predecessors, the show still had its moments and managed to attract a dedicated fan base. The criticism of the producers and showrunner may be valid, but there were still aspects of the series that were enjoyable and engaging for fans of the 'Star Trek' franchise."

Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).",

While there are valid points about the inconsistencies with the original series, I believe that Star Trek: Enterprise still had its own merits and provided a fresh perspective on the Star Trek universe.

Oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode but after that I totally gave up on Enterprise and turned to TV right off. Come on!!!! This is star trek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also what was with the banana slug?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason. Okay fine, little dumb to bring your pet slug in space but whatever. Okay that was what I thought until they left it on a desert planet!!!!! A BANANA SLUG CANNOT LIVE IN A DESERT!!!! How dumb are these writers Anyways, just saying if Enterprise is on DON'T WATCH IT!!!!!",
  "agree": "I completely understand your frustration with the direction 'Enterprise' took in deviating from the traditional 'Star Trek' formula. The cowboy-like portrayal of Archer and the romantic subplot between him and T'Pol may have felt out of place for fans expecting a more exploration-focused narrative. The mishandling of the banana slug subplot also seemed like a strange choice that detracted from the overall credibility of the show. It's disappointing when a beloved franchise like 'Star Trek' fails to live up to its established standards.",
  "disagree": "While I acknowledge your disappointment with the changes in 'Enterprise,' I believe that the series attempted to bring a fresh perspective to the 'Star Trek' universe. By introducing new character dynamics and exploring different storytelling approaches, the show aimed to appeal to a broader audience and evolve the franchise. While not every creative decision may have resonated with fans, it's important to appreciate the effort to innovate and take risks in a long-running series like 'Star Trek.' Each iteration brings its own unique elements, and 'Enterprise' should be commended for trying to break new ground."

I will admit that I did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining. And that Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack. But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series. 3/10",

Although Turturro is an actor I generally like, his Luzhin often resembled a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall it seems as if this film is trying too hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances.",
    "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The beginning of the film had promise, but as it progressed, it lost its charm and became cliché.

The movie twists and turns through myriad plot 'surprises' at a desperate attempt to keep the audience guessing, puncturing the 'plot' with steamy scenes they thought would help it along. James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleepwalks through the movie. The same applies for the other 'actors'. The plot is quite silly and tacky, which in itself is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot twists get very tiresome and boring. However, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. In all, worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one. A rather lame 4!",

The inclusion of steamy scenes added a layer of intrigue to the story, and I appreciated the attempt to create a complex narrative. James Belushi's performance, though subdued, fit the tone of the movie well. The film may not be perfect, but it offers a unique viewing experience that is worth a watch, especially for those looking for something different."

  "review": "If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimp, or John Wayne as a Communist spy, then you might believe Pat Boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie. This film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. And the problem is that Hollywood made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss Shirley Jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the 'screen consummation' of their love. It's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns. The story is pointless. Even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm. April Love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The premise of the movie sounds absurd and the lack of chemistry between the leads due to the no-kissing rule takes away any potential for emotional investment from the audience. The overall execution seems to be lacking, making it difficult to find any redeeming qualities in this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the concept may sound unconventional, sometimes movies that push boundaries can be entertaining in their own way. Pat Boone's portrayal as a juvenile delinquent on a farm could offer a unique perspective, and the restrictions placed on the romantic scenes could add a layer of tension and anticipation. Additionally, the comparison to Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space may be too harsh, as every film has its own merits and audience appeal."

  "review": "I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of 'Buffalo Bill,' 'Wild Bill Hickok,' and 'Calamity Jane,' all of whom are in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great. The trouble was.....it wasn't. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this, being bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just did not look like nor act like 'Buffalo Bill.' Cooper wasn't at his best, either, sounding too wooden. This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor. In a nutshell, his western shot blanks. Head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. As a fan of the western genre and the historical figures featured in the film, I had high hopes for it. However, I also found the pacing to be slow and the performances lacking. Jean Arthur's character was indeed grating, and the portrayal of 'Buffalo Bill' fell short. Gary Cooper's performance felt lackluster compared to his later work. Overall, I was disappointed by the film and would recommend seeking out other, more engaging westerns.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the criticisms of the film's pacing and character portrayals, I found the historical context and the presence of iconic figures like 'Buffalo Bill,' 'Wild Bill Hickok,' and 'Calamity Jane' to be intriguing. Gary Cooper's performance, though not his best, still carried the film with his presence. I believe that despite its flaws, the film offers a unique perspective on the Wild West and is worth a watch for fans of the genre."

  "review": "I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. I therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts. Her character's rescue from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip had been turned down by the US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities. The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the South Pole base. I feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task. I fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a USAF Hercules.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with the reviewer's point about the importance of accurately portraying the real-life events and individuals involved in the rescue mission. It's disappointing when filmmakers take liberties with historical facts, especially when it diminishes the contributions of the actual heroes who were involved in the rescue. Susan Sarandon's talents as an actor could have been better utilized in a film that stayed true to the bravery and sacrifices of the Canadian rescue pilots.",
  "disagree": "While I understand the reviewer's concern about the inaccuracies in the film's portrayal of the rescue mission, I believe that artistic license is often taken in movies based on true events. The filmmakers may have chosen to alter certain details for dramatic effect or narrative purposes, rather than to intentionally disregard the bravery of the Canadian rescue pilots. Susan Sarandon's performance and the overall storytelling may still have merit, even if the historical accuracy is not perfect."

  "review": "Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada. Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.",
  "agree": "I agree with the review that the film was a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda. It is disappointing to see the real rescuers, like Kenn Borek Air, not being properly represented in the film.",
  "disagree": "I disagree with the review's criticism of the film being libelous and scandalous. While the portrayal of the USAF as the heroes may be inaccurate, it is not necessarily libelous. The film may have taken creative liberties for dramatic effect, which is common in historical dramas."

  "review": "OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's outdated visuals and confusing plot made it a disappointing watch. The lack of a proper introduction and the excessive fantasy elements only added to the confusion. I also found the characters to be strange and the overall flow of the scenes to be disjointed. I would also recommend The Promise over this film for a better Chinese epic fantasy experience.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the film may have a unique visual style reminiscent of the 80s, I found it to be a deliberate artistic choice that added to the overall charm of the movie. The complex plot and fantasy elements may not be for everyone, but I appreciated the creativity and boldness in storytelling. The characters' eccentricities and the non-linear scenes only enhanced the mysterious and otherworldly atmosphere of the film. In my opinion, this movie offers a refreshing take on the Chinese epic fantasy genre and is worth a watch for those looking for something different."

  "review": "Zu Warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid. The movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something. Whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical God/Demon/Wizard thing. The plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie. The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying, princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something. Even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like (yes that's a word!). I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand....who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all. It felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time. I can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching Inu-Yasha at episode 134 drunk...yeah that's right you don't know what the hell is going on. Don't waste your brain trying to figure this out.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. 'Zu Warriors' was a confusing mess of a movie with a convoluted plot and bizarre visuals. It felt like trying to make sense of a jumbled anime episode while on a psychedelic trip. The lack of coherent storytelling and poorly executed fight scenes made it a frustrating viewing experience. I also found it difficult to follow the storyline and felt lost throughout the film. This movie would have been better suited as an animated series where the fantastical elements could have been explored in a more cohesive manner.",

  "review": "This is not so much film as big budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'Insomnia'. When it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought 'Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!' but no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long, white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. That's not a good sign. I found the special effects to be somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The film's bizarre plot and low-quality special effects make it feel more like a cheesy children's TV show than a serious martial arts film. The villain being a swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans and the strange subplot about insomnia only add to the confusion and lack of coherence in the movie. The comparison to Xena: Warrior Princess in terms of special effects is spot on, as the visuals feel outdated and unimpressive.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While Zu Warriors may have a unique and unconventional storyline, it offers a refreshing departure from traditional martial arts films. The creative choice of having a villain like a swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans adds a whimsical and imaginative element to the movie. The special effects, though not on par with modern standards, contribute to the film's charm and nostalgic appeal, reminiscent of classic fantasy films like those by Ray Harryhausen."

  "review": "Watched this on DVD in original language with English subs. Either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development. There are quite a few HK stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long. If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot. I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The subtitling or dialogues did not contribute to the story or character development. The presence of HK stars did not add value to the movie, and the excessive use of CG scenes became overwhelming. The film felt like a chaotic mix of fight scenes and a weak plot, resembling a child's movie rather than a well-crafted film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While the subtitling may have been lacking, I found the bright and colorful CG scenes to be visually appealing and engaging. The presence of HK stars added a certain charm to the movie, and I believe the nonstop action and fight scenes added to the entertainment value. Despite any flaws in the delivery of the story, I still found the overall experience enjoyable and entertaining."

  "review": "Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? Nobody should love that.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with Lucius Shepard's review of 'The Color Purple'. The film's excessive sentimentality and lack of narrative honesty detract from the overall impact of the story. The jarring mix of dark themes with whimsical cinematography and misplaced comedy creates a disjointed viewing experience that fails to do justice to the source material.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with Lucius Shepard's review of 'The Color Purple'. While the film may have its flaws in terms of tone and execution, it still manages to convey important themes of female empowerment and resilience in the face of adversity. The performances, particularly by the lead actresses, bring depth and emotion to the characters, making the film a poignant exploration of the human spirit."

  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The sentimentality in the movie felt forced and unrealistic. The contrived scenes and exaggerated emotions took away from the authenticity of the story. Spielberg's direction did not deserve an Oscar for this film.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with the review. While I understand the criticism of the sentimentality in the movie, I believe Spielberg's direction still showcased his talent. The emotional depth and character development in the film, despite some contrived moments, were still impactful. Spielberg's ability to evoke strong emotions from the audience should not be discounted."

  "review": "This is really terrible. The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched, I would have a suitable reply. I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies. There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie. I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable.",
  "agree": "I completely agree with this review. The movie sounds like a disaster from start to finish, with tacky filming, amateurish fight choreography, and unconvincing performances. It's disappointing to hear that some have hyped it up as the best movie since The Matrix, as it clearly falls short in every aspect.",
  "disagree": "I respectfully disagree with this review. While the movie may have its flaws, such as low budget constraints and subpar fight scenes, it's important to acknowledge the effort that goes into making a film. Criticizing the appearance of the actress and the director's casting choices seems unnecessarily harsh and disrespectful. Every movie has its audience, and some may appreciate the film for its unique qualities despite its shortcomings."
