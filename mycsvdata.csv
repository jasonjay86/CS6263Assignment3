"There's one line that makes it worth to rent for Angel fans. Everyone else: this is just a very bad horror flick. The female characters are typical horror movies females. They are wooden, annoying and dumb. You are glad when they are killed off. Long live the strong female character in a horror movie!!",I agree with the review. The female characters in this movie were indeed poorly written and lacked depth. It's disappointing to see such stereotypical portrayals in a modern horror film.,"I disagree with the review. While the female characters may not have been the strongest, the movie still had some redeeming qualities that make it worth watching, especially for fans of Angel. The horror genre often relies on certain tropes, and this film may have been playing into that intentionally."
